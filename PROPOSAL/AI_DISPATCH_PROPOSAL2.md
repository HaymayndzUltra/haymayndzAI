1) Command Routing & AI Agent Dispatch Logic
Component Under Review: rules_master_toggle.mdc driven router → product_owner_ai → planning_ai → codegen_ai → qa_ai (success path), with branch to documentation_ai; support: analyst_ai
Goal of the Analysis: Establish a precise, auditable routing matrix from commands to target AIs, including enable/disable semantics and fallback behavior.
Inputs/Artifacts:
Diagram: /home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/…/diagram.png
rules_master_toggle.mdc
Component contracts/interfaces for: product_owner_ai, planning_ai, codegen_ai, qa_ai, documentation_ai, analyst_ai
Out‑of‑Scope:
Implementing routing changes
Creating new agents or APIs
Performance tuning beyond identifying measurement points
Key Questions & Considerations:
What commands/events does rules_master_toggle.mdc recognize, and how are toggle states resolved?
Deterministic routing: how are conflicts, priorities, and “/backlog” versus “/router” branches handled?
Idempotency and retries: how are duplicate commands suppressed?
Failure handling: fallback agent, dead‑letter lane, or user‑visible error?
Concurrency limits and sequencing guarantees between product_owner_ai → planning_ai → codegen_ai → qa_ai
Observability hooks at routing boundaries (trace IDs, correlation IDs)
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Toggle misconfiguration leading to command drop or infinite deferral
Race conditions when multiple toggles or routes match
Partial activation (some agents enabled, others not) causing broken pipelines
Backlog starvation or priority inversion
Deliverables:
Routing Matrix (command → agent path) as a Markdown table
Decision rules for toggles/priorities as bulletized policy
Sequence sketch for normal and degraded flows
Acceptance Criteria:
Every documented command maps to exactly one primary path and zero or one fallback path
All toggle combinations and their effects are enumerated
Clear specification of error paths and retries with limits
2) QA Gate & Pass/Fail Loop
Component Under Review: codegen_ai ↔ qa_ai with QA Gate loop back to codegen_ai on FAIL
Goal of the Analysis: Define quality gating criteria, loop controls, and escalation/exit conditions independent of implementation.
Inputs/Artifacts:
Diagram: /home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/…/diagram.png
Contracts/specs for codegen_ai, qa_ai
Any gate policy references (if present) and rules_master_toggle.mdc for contextual gating switches
Out‑of‑Scope:
Writing or changing tests/linters
Implementing scoring models or thresholds
Key Questions & Considerations:
PASS/FAIL criteria inputs and required evidence (artifacts, tests, static checks)
Loop policy: max iterations, exponential backoff, and termination reasons
Defect categorization and what triggers re‑codegen versus escalation
Gate observability: metrics, logs, and audit record of decisions
Interaction with documentation generation when QA fails/succeeds
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Infinite loop risk if criteria are unachievable
False positives/negatives in QA signals causing churn
Drift between qa_ai criteria and codegen_ai capabilities
Deliverables:
Gate Decision Policy (PASS/FAIL matrix with inputs/thresholds)
Loop Control Policy (iteration cap, backoff, escalation path)
Audit/telemetry checklist for each gate decision
Acceptance Criteria:
PASS/FAIL states and artifacts are unambiguous
Loop termination is guaranteed under defined conditions
Audit fields and retention expectations are listed
3) Execution Orchestrator State Machine
Component Under Review: execution_orchestrator state machine: IDLE → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING
Goal of the Analysis: Specify allowed transitions, entry/exit conditions, and recovery paths, including blocked states from QA or routing failures.
Inputs/Artifacts:
Diagram: /home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/…/diagram.png
execution_orchestrator specification or source (names as in repo)
Context from rules_master_toggle.mdc and QA Gate behavior
Out‑of‑Scope:
Implementing state handlers or timers
CI/CD configuration details
Key Questions & Considerations:
Transition guards and required artifacts per state
Reversion/rollback transitions (e.g., from DEPLOYMENT back to DEVELOPMENT)
Handling of “BLOCKED” conditions and resume policies
Timeouts, heartbeats, and stuck‑state detection
Idempotent re‑entry guarantees
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Partial completion causing ambiguous state
Inconsistent artifacts across states (e.g., test reports missing during TESTING)
Orchestrator crash/restart and replay semantics
Deliverables:
State Transition Table (from, to, guard, produced artifacts)
Recovery/rollback flowchart
Stuck‑state detection and alert policy
Acceptance Criteria:
All states have defined entry/exit criteria and artifacts
No undocumented transitions exist
Clear procedures for rollback and resume are documented
4) Memory & Context Persistence
Component Under Review: framework_memory_bridge.mdc with memory-bank/queue-system/*, cursor_state.json, current-session.md
Goal of the Analysis: Document read paths, write constraints, and consistency expectations across memory artifacts.
Inputs/Artifacts:
Diagram: /home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/…/diagram.png
framework_memory_bridge.mdc
memory-bank/queue-system/*
cursor_state.json
current-session.md
Out‑of‑Scope:
Changing storage formats or persistence backends
PII policy writing beyond identifying where it would apply
Key Questions & Considerations:
Which components read/write which files, and under what conditions?
Consistency model (eventual vs. strong) and conflict resolution
Session continuity: recovery on crash/restart; pointer validity in cursor_state.json
Retention and rotation for memory-bank/queue-system/*
Access control expectations (read‑only vs. write‑allowed actors)
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Concurrent writes and corruption
Broken references across sessions causing stale context usage
Large backlogs impacting performance or I/O limits
Deliverables:
RACI map (reader/writer matrix per artifact)
Consistency/retention policy summary
Session continuity checklist
Acceptance Criteria:
Each artifact has explicit ownership, read/write permissions, and retention
Conflict and recovery procedures are described
No ambiguous or undocumented consumers remain
5) Documentation & Analyst Side‑Paths
Component Under Review: codegen_ai → documentation_ai; support: analyst_ai
Goal of the Analysis: Clarify when and how documentation is generated, enriched by analyst_ai, and where it is stored.
Inputs/Artifacts:
Diagram: /home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/…/diagram.png
Contracts/specs for documentation_ai, analyst_ai, and codegen_ai
Any repo paths where docs are persisted (names as in repo)
Out‑of‑Scope:
Authoring content or templates
Toolchain selection for docs rendering
Key Questions & Considerations:
Triggers for documentation generation (on PASS only? on FAIL too?)
Output formats, locations, and versioning
analyst_ai role: validation, enrichment, or review gates
Linkage between docs and orchestrator states (e.g., during PLANNING vs DEPLOYMENT)
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Divergence between generated docs and current artifacts
Missing provenance (no trace back to runs/builds)
Over‑generation causing noise or stale docs
Deliverables:
Documentation trigger matrix and artifact inventory
Provenance and versioning model
Minimal SLOs for freshness and completeness
Acceptance Criteria:
Every documented artifact has a clear trigger and storage path
Provenance captured (source, run ID, time)
Review loop with analyst_ai is defined and measurable
6) Deployment & Observability Handoffs
Component Under Review: mlops_ai → observability_ai
Goal of the Analysis: Define the contract for deployment outputs consumed by observability, including signals, health, and rollback hooks.
Inputs/Artifacts:
Diagram: /home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/…/diagram.png
Contracts/specs for mlops_ai and observability_ai
Orchestrator state ties to DEPLOYMENT and MONITORING
Out‑of‑Scope:
Creating dashboards, alerts, or pipelines
Modifying CI/CD tooling
Key Questions & Considerations:
Deployment artifact types and metadata required by observability_ai
Health/heartbeat interfaces; what constitutes “ready” and “healthy”
Rollback signals and conditions surfaced to orchestrator
Telemetry schema (traces, metrics, logs) and correlation with runs
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Mismatch in artifact formats or missing metadata
Blind spots (no post‑deploy validation before “healthy”)
Rollback paths not observable by the orchestrator
Deliverables:
Deployment→Observability contract (fields, schemas, timing)
Health/rollback signaling map
Post‑deploy validation checklist
Acceptance Criteria:
Contract fields are complete and versioned
Health and rollback signals are unambiguous and testable
Post‑deploy validation steps are declared and linked to orchestrator transitions
Each brief is intended for a separate, fresh session.
