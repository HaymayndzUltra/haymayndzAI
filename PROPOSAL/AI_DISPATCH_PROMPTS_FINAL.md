- Standard outputs per vertical:
  - VERIFICATION/<vertical>/report.md
  - VERIFICATION/<vertical>/findings.json
- Suggested branch naming for BA runs: ba/<vertical>/<short-id>

1) Command Routing & AI Agent Dispatch Logic
Component Under Review
- .cursor/rules/rules_master_toggle.mdc driven router → product_owner_ai → planning_ai → codegen_ai → qa_ai (success path); branch to documentation_ai; analyst_ai support

Goal of the Analysis
- Establish a precise, auditable routing matrix from commands to target AIs, including enable/disable semantics and fallback behavior.

Inputs/Artifacts
- PROPOSAL/proposal_3.md (workflow)
- .cursor/rules/rules_master_toggle.mdc
- Role contracts: frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/*.mdc

Out‑of‑Scope
- Implementing routing changes; creating new agents/APIs; performance tuning beyond identifying measurement points

Key Questions & Considerations
- Recognized commands/events and toggle resolution
- Deterministic routing and conflict/priority handling; idempotency and retries
- Failure handling (fallback agent, dead‑letter, user‑visible errors)
- Observability at routing boundaries (trace/correlation IDs)

Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect
- Toggle misconfiguration; partial activation causing broken pipelines
- Race conditions when multiple routes match; backlog starvation

Deliverables
- VERIFICATION/routing/report.md
- VERIFICATION/routing/findings.json (routing matrix, toggle policy, error paths)

Acceptance Criteria
- Every documented command maps to exactly one primary path and ≤1 fallback
- All toggle combinations and effects enumerated; error/retry policy explicit

2) QA Gate & Pass/Fail Loop
Component Under Review
- codegen_ai ↔ qa_ai with QA Gate loop back to codegen_ai on FAIL

Goal of the Analysis
- Define quality gating criteria, loop controls, and escalation/exit conditions independent of implementation.

Inputs/Artifacts
- PROPOSAL/proposal_3.md (workflow)
- frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/execution_orchestrator.mdc (gate context)
- Role specs for codegen_ai, qa_ai

Out‑of‑Scope
- Writing/changing tests; implementing scoring/threshold models

Key Questions & Considerations
- PASS/FAIL evidence (artifacts/tests/static checks);
- Loop policy (cap, backoff, escalation); gate observability/audit
- Interaction with documentation generation on PASS/FAIL

Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect
- Infinite loop risk; QA false pos/neg; drift between qa_ai and codegen_ai

Deliverables
- VERIFICATION/qa_gate/report.md
- VERIFICATION/qa_gate/findings.json (decision matrix, loop control, audit fields)

Acceptance Criteria
- PASS/FAIL states/artifacts unambiguous; termination guaranteed; audit fields/retention listed

3) Execution Orchestrator State Machine
Component Under Review
- execution_orchestrator: IDLE → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING (BLOCKED/ROLLBACK as recovery)

Goal of the Analysis
- Specify allowed transitions, guards, entry/exit artifacts, and recovery paths.

Inputs/Artifacts
- PROPOSAL/proposal_3.md (workflow states)
- frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/execution_orchestrator.mdc

Out‑of‑Scope
- Implementing state handlers/timers; CI/CD specifics

Key Questions & Considerations
- Transition guards and required artifacts per state; rollback transitions
- Handling of BLOCKED; timeouts/heartbeats; idempotent re‑entry

Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect
- Partial completion ambiguity; missing artifacts in TESTING; crash/restart replay

Deliverables
- VERIFICATION/orchestrator/report.md
- VERIFICATION/orchestrator/findings.json (transition table, recovery/rollback, stuck‑state policy)

Acceptance Criteria
- All states have defined entry/exit criteria and artifacts; no undocumented transitions; rollback/resume documented (target ≥90% coverage for critical transitions in planned tests)

4) Memory & Context Persistence
Component Under Review
- framework_memory_bridge.mdc with memory-bank/queue-system/*, cursor_state.json, current-session.md

Goal of the Analysis
- Document read paths, write constraints, consistency and retention expectations.

Inputs/Artifacts
- PROPOSAL/proposal_3.md (workflow)
- frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/framework_memory_bridge.mdc
- memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json
- cursor_state.json, memory-bank/current-session.md

Out‑of‑Scope
- Changing storage formats/backends; writing PII policy

Key Questions & Considerations
- Reader/writer ownership; conflict resolution; +08:00 timestamp enforcement
- Session continuity on crash; integrity checks; pruning/compaction

Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect
- Concurrent writes; broken references; backlog size performance

Deliverables
- VERIFICATION/memory/report.md
- VERIFICATION/memory/findings.json (RACI, consistency/retention, continuity checklist)

Acceptance Criteria
- Explicit ownership and retention per artifact; conflict/recovery procedures defined; integrity checks planned

5) Documentation & Analyst Side‑Paths
Component Under Review
- codegen_ai → documentation_ai; analyst_ai support

Goal of the Analysis
- Clarify when/how docs are generated, enriched by analyst_ai, and stored/versioned.

Inputs/Artifacts
- PROPOSAL/proposal_3.md (workflow)
- Role specs for documentation_ai, analyst_ai, codegen_ai

Out‑of‑Scope
- Authoring content/templates; toolchain selection for rendering

Key Questions & Considerations
- Triggers (post‑QA vs parallel); output formats/locations; provenance
- Analyst role: validation/enrichment; linkage to orchestrator states

Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect
- Docs for code that later fails QA; stale docs; merge conflicts

Deliverables
- VERIFICATION/docs_analyst/report.md
- VERIFICATION/docs_analyst/findings.json (trigger matrix, provenance, SLOs)

Acceptance Criteria
- Every documented artifact has a clear trigger and storage path; provenance captured; review loop defined

6) Deployment & Observability Handoffs
Component Under Review
- mlops_ai → observability_ai after QA Gate PASS

Goal of the Analysis
- Define the contract for deployment outputs consumed by observability (signals, health, rollback hooks).

Inputs/Artifacts
- PROPOSAL/proposal_3.md (workflow)
- Role specs for mlops_ai and observability_ai

Out‑of‑Scope
- Creating dashboards/alerts/pipelines; modifying CI/CD tooling

Key Questions & Considerations
- Deployment artifact types/metadata; health/heartbeat; rollback signals; telemetry schema

Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect
- Format mismatches; blind spots pre‑health; rollback not observable

Deliverables
- VERIFICATION/deploy_obs/report.md
- VERIFICATION/deploy_obs/findings.json (contract fields, health/rollback map, post‑deploy validation)

Acceptance Criteria
- Contract fields complete/versioned; health & rollback signals unambiguous/testable; post‑deploy validation steps declared and tied to orchestrator transitions

Final Note
- Each brief is intended for a separate, fresh session. No brief assumes prior analysis outcomes or shared mutable state.
