1) Command Routing & AI Agent Dispatch Logic
Component Under Review: rules_master_toggle.mdc routing layer (user → Router → product_owner_ai / planning_ai / codegen_ai / qa_ai)
Goal of the Analysis: Validate command parsing, trigger precedence, and dispatch decisions; confirm right‑most precedence and master enable/disable behavior.
Inputs/Artifacts:
memory-bank/rules/rules_master_toggle.mdc
memory-bank/rules/trigger_phrases.mdc
Diagram section: Router diamond and downstream arrows
Out‑of‑Scope: Internal logic of downstream AIs; deep NLP of user commands.
Key Questions & Considerations:
Are enable/disable tokens absolute overrides across all routes?
How are conflicting triggers resolved (right‑most precedence, case handling)?
Are tokens inside code fences/quotes ignored as specified?
How is rate limiting/malicious input handled?
Does /router self-call avoid infinite loops?
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Simultaneous [cursor-rules:on] and [windsurf-rules:on]
Triggers embedded in code fences or quotes
Case-insensitive collisions and substring matches
Router recursion or fallback loops
Deliverables:
analysis/routing_logic_review.md (markdown report)
Annotated flowchart of actual precedence resolution
List of ambiguities with recommended clarifications
Acceptance Criteria:
All documented triggers map to exactly one action path
Right‑most precedence and master toggles verified with at least 10 unit tests
No ambiguous or cyclic routing scenarios remain
2) QA Gate & Pass/Fail Loop
Component Under Review: codegen_ai ↔ qa_ai interaction governed by QA Gate; failure loops back to codegen_ai.
Goal of the Analysis: Define pass/fail criteria, thresholds, loop-back mechanics, and termination guarantees.
Inputs/Artifacts:
QA Gate spec (search qa_gate.mdc or embedded in memory-bank/rules/*)
Code path(s) connecting codegen_ai and qa_ai
Diagram arrow “FAIL ↩︎ QA Gate”
Out‑of‑Scope: Internal scoring heuristics of qa_ai beyond interfaces.
Key Questions & Considerations:
What constitutes “FAIL/PASS”; are severities thresholded?
Retry policy (max attempts, backoff)?
How is state preserved across retries; is feedback visible to planning_ai?
How are partial passes handled?
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Live‑lock if outputs never satisfy QA
Version drift across successive codegen_ai iterations
Inconsistent artifacts after partial passes
Deliverables:
analysis/qa_gate_loop.md
Sequence diagram of fail‑retry‑pass cycle
Checklist of gating parameters and defaults
Acceptance Criteria:
Clear, documented pass/fail thresholds
Explicit termination/escape path (e.g., max retries or alternate route)
Alignment with system SLAs (latency/resource caps)
3) Execution Orchestrator State Machine
Component Under Review: execution_orchestrator states: IDLE → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING.
Goal of the Analysis: Verify state transitions, guards, recovery, and persistence.
Inputs/Artifacts:
execution_orchestrator implementation file(s)
/docs/orchestrator_states.md (if present)
Diagram right‑hand state column
Out‑of‑Scope: Internal tasks executed within each state.
Key Questions & Considerations:
Are transitions reversible/recoverable; what are error guards?
Is current state persisted and restored on restart?
Concurrency: single task vs multiplexed tasks?
Sync with memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Stuck states on crash/restart
Skipping TESTING prior to DEPLOYMENT
Divergence from tasks_active.json after manual edits
Deliverables:
analysis/orchestrator_fsm.md
State/event/guard table
Recommended assertion tests per transition
Acceptance Criteria:
One‑to‑one mapping between documented and implemented transitions
Defined failsafe rollback for all non‑terminal states
100% unit‑test coverage on transition logic
4) Memory & Context Persistence
Component Under Review: framework_memory_bridge.mdc with memory-bank/queue-system/*, cursor_state.json, current-session.md.
Goal of the Analysis: Ensure consistent, lossless context handoff between sessions/components; validate UTC+8 timestamp policy.
Inputs/Artifacts:
framework_memory_bridge.mdc
memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json
cursor_state.json, current-session.md
Out‑of‑Scope: Semantic content of stored memories.
Key Questions & Considerations:
Read/write lock strategy; avoidance of race conditions
Timestamp consistency and timezone enforcement (+08:00)
Integrity, backup, and recovery for corrupted files
ID consistency across files and sessions
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Simultaneous writes from multiple AIs
Memory bloat; pruning/compaction policy
Inconsistent task IDs or partial writes
Deliverables:
analysis/memory_bridge.md
Failure‑mode table with mitigations
Integrity‑check script outline (read‑only prototype plan)
Acceptance Criteria:
No data‑loss scenarios found in planned fault‑injection matrix
All timestamps validated for timezone compliance
Prototype checker plan covers integrity, IDs, and backups
5) Documentation & Analyst Side-Paths
Component Under Review: codegen_ai → documentation_ai; analyst_ai support.
Goal of the Analysis: Define deterministic doc generation triggers and analyst feedback loop timing/permissions.
Inputs/Artifacts:
documentation_ai invocation specs
analyst_ai assist scripts/specs
Diagram side arrows from codegen_ai
Out‑of‑Scope: Editorial quality of docs (grammar/style).
Key Questions & Considerations:
When are docs generated (post‑QA vs parallel)?
Does analyst_ai write to repo or comment‑only?
Versioning and alignment of docs with code commits/releases
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Docs for code that later fails QA
Stale docs if analyst feedback lags
Merge conflicts from simultaneous edits
Deliverables:
analysis/doc_paths.md
Flowchart for doc generation and approval
Gap analysis vs required artifacts (API refs, CHANGELOG)
Acceptance Criteria:
Documented, deterministic trigger points for doc generation
Analyst feedback incorporated before DEPLOYMENT phase
Conformance to release checklist in VERIFICATION/README.md
6) Deployment & Observability Handoffs
Component Under Review: mlops_ai → observability_ai after QA Gate PASS.
Goal of the Analysis: Validate deployment integration and observability readiness gates.
Inputs/Artifacts:
mlops_ai deployment scripts/specs
observability_ai dashboards/alert configs
Diagram arrow mlops_ai → observability_ai
Out‑of‑Scope: Cloud‑specific low‑level details handled elsewhere.
Key Questions & Considerations:
Are observability hooks injected at build or post‑deploy?
SLA/SLI definitions and ownership boundaries
Rollback triggers based on observability signals
Risks/Edge Cases to Inspect:
Metrics emitted only after critical failure
Alert fatigue from redundant signals
DEPLOYMENT marked complete before observability is ready
Deliverables:
analysis/deploy_obs_handoff.md
Checklist mapping deployment stages to observability checks
Synthetic canary tests specification (planning)
Acceptance Criteria:
Observability endpoints live and reporting before DEPLOYMENT completion
Proven rollback path in staging simulation plan
Dashboards/alerts cover critical SLIs (latency, error rate, saturation)
Final note: Each brief is intended for a separate, fresh session. No brief assumes prior analysis outcomes or shared mutable state.
