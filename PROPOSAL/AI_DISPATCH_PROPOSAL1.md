1. Command Routing & AI Agent Dispatch Logic
   Component Under Review: rules_master_toggle.mdc routing layer (user → Router → product_owner_ai / planning_ai / codegen_ai / qa_ai)
   Goal of the Analysis:
   Validate command parsing, routing decisions, and fallback behavior against the documented triggers and precedence rules.
   Inputs / Artifacts:
   /memory-bank/rules/rules_master_toggle.mdc
   /memory-bank/rules/trigger_phrases.mdc
   Diagram section: Router diamond and downstream arrows
   Out-of-Scope:
   Internal logic of individual downstream AIs (handled in their own briefs)
   Deep linguistic analysis of user commands
   Key Questions & Considerations:
   Are precedence rules unambiguous and correctly ordered?
   Do enable/disable tokens reliably override all other rules?
   How are conflicting triggers resolved (right-most precedence implementation)?
   Rate-limiting / safety mechanisms for malformed or malicious commands.
   Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect:
   Simultaneous [cursor-rules:on] and [windsurf-rules:on] tokens
   Commands containing triggers inside code fences or quotes
   Case-insensitive token matching collisions
   Infinite routing loops if Router misclassifies /router self-calls
   Deliverables:
   Markdown review report analysis/routing_logic_review.md
   Annotated flowchart reflecting actual precedence resolution
   List of detected ambiguities with recommended clarifications
   Acceptance Criteria:
   All documented triggers mapped to exactly one action path
   No ambiguous or cyclic precedence scenarios remain
   Router behavior matches at least 10 representative command unit tests
2. QA Gate & Pass/Fail Loop
   Component Under Review: codegen_ai → qa_ai interaction governed by QA Gate
   Goal of the Analysis:
   Assess the pass/fail criteria, gating thresholds, and loop-back mechanics that return failed outputs to codegen_ai.
   Inputs / Artifacts:
   QA Gate specification (search: qa_gate.mdc or embedded rules)
   Code flow between codegen_ai and qa_ai (repo modules)
   Diagram arrow: “FAIL ↩︎ QA Gate”
   Out-of-Scope:
   Internal code quality metrics used by qa_ai (scored separately)
   Upstream command routing logic
   Key Questions & Considerations:
   What constitutes a “FAIL”? Severity thresholds?
   Is there a retry limit or exponential back-off?
   How is state preserved between iterations?
   Visibility of QA feedback to other AIs (e.g., planning_ai).
   Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect:
   Live-lock if outputs never satisfy QA criteria
   Partial passes resulting in inconsistent artifacts downstream
   Version drift between successive codegen iterations
   Deliverables:
   Review memo analysis/qa_gate_loop.md
   Sequence diagram of at least one fail-retry-pass cycle
   Checklist of gating parameters and their default values
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Clear, documented pass/fail thresholds
   Demonstrated termination guarantee (max retries or alternative path)
   Alignment with overall system SLAs (latency, resource usage)
3. Execution Orchestrator State Machine
   Component Under Review: execution_orchestrator (states: IDLE → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING)
   Goal of the Analysis:
   Verify correctness of state transitions, guarding conditions, and recovery paths.
   Inputs / Artifacts:
   execution_orchestrator implementation file(s)
   State diagrams in /docs/orchestrator_states.md (if present)
   Diagram’s right-hand vertical state boxes
   Out-of-Scope:
   Internal tasks executed within each state (handled by specific AIs)
   Key Questions & Considerations:
   Are all transitions reversible or recoverable on failure?
   Persistence mechanism for current state across restarts
   Concurrency: can multiple tasks occupy the orchestrator simultaneously?
   Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect:
   Orchestrator stuck between states on crash
   Skipped TESTING step leading directly to DEPLOYMENT
   State mismatch with tasks_active.json after manual edits
   Deliverables:
   Finite State Machine (FSM) audit analysis/orchestrator_fsm.md
   Table of states vs allowed events and guards
   Recommended assertion tests for each transition
   Acceptance Criteria:
   One-to-one mapping between documented and implemented transitions
   Failsafe rollback defined for every non-terminal state
   100 % unit-test coverage for state transition logic
4. Memory & Context Persistence
   Component Under Review: framework_memory_bridge.mdc and associated files (memory-bank/queue-system/\*, cursor_state.json, current-session.md)
   Goal of the Analysis:
   Ensure consistent, lossless context handoff between sessions and across AI components.
   Inputs / Artifacts:
   framework_memory_bridge.mdc
   Sample memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json
   cursor_state.json, current-session.md
   Out-of-Scope:
   Content semantics of memories (other teams will analyze)
   Key Questions & Considerations:
   How are read/write locks managed to avoid race conditions?
   Timestamp consistency (UTC+8 enforcement)
   Backup & recovery strategy for corrupted memory files
   Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect:
   Simultaneous writes from multiple AIs
   Memory bloat / pruning policy
   Inconsistent task IDs between files
   Deliverables:
   Persistence design review analysis/memory_bridge.md
   Failure-mode table with mitigation strategies
   Proposed automated integrity-check script outline
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Zero data-loss scenarios uncovered in fault-injection tests
   All timestamp fields validated for timezone compliance
   Memory integrity checker prototype passes on sample corpora
5. Documentation & Analyst Side-Paths
   Component Under Review: codegen_ai → documentation_ai flow and analyst_ai support functions
   Goal of the Analysis:
   Review documentation generation triggers and analyst feedback loops for completeness and accuracy.
   Inputs / Artifacts:
   documentation_ai invocation specs
   analyst_ai assist scripts
   Diagram’s side arrows from codegen_ai
   Out-of-Scope:
   Actual documentation content quality (grammar/style)
   Key Questions & Considerations:
   When is documentation generated—after QA pass or in parallel?
   Does analyst_ai have write access to codebase or comment-only?
   Versioning of generated docs relative to code commits.
   Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect:
   Docs generated for code that later fails QA
   Stale documentation if analyst_ai feedback is delayed
   Merge conflicts from simultaneous doc edits
   Deliverables:
   Interaction review analysis/doc_paths.md
   Flowchart of doc generation and approval cycle
   Gap analysis against required doc artifacts (API refs, CHANGELOG)
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Documented, deterministic trigger points for doc generation
   Analyst feedback incorporated before deployment phase
   Alignment with release checklist in /VERIFICATION/README.md
6. Deployment & Observability Handoffs
   Component Under Review: mlops_ai to observability_ai transition post-QA Gate PASS
   Goal of the Analysis:
   Validate deployment pipeline integration with observability instrumentation.
   Inputs / Artifacts:
   mlops_ai deployment scripts
   observability_ai dashboards / alert configs
   Diagram arrow mlops_ai → observability_ai
   Out-of-Scope:
   Low-level cloud provider specifics (handled elsewhere)
   Key Questions & Considerations:
   Are observability hooks injected during build or post-deploy?
   SLA/SLI definitions and ownership boundaries
   Rollback triggers based on observability alerts
   Risks / Edge Cases to Inspect:
   Metrics not emitted until after critical failure
   Alert fatigue from redundant signals
   Deployment success marked before observability ready
   Deliverables:
   Pipeline handoff review analysis/deploy_obs_handoff.md
   Checklist mapping deployment stages to required observability checks
   Suggested synthetic canary tests specification
   Acceptance Criteria:
   Observability endpoints live and reporting before DEPLOYMENT marked complete
   Automated rollback path proven in staging simulation
   Dashboards/alerts cover all critical SLIs (latency, error rate, saturation)
   Final Note:
   Each brief is intended for a separate, fresh session. No brief assumes prior analysis outcomes or shared mutable state.
