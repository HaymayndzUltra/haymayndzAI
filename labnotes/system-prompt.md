# Lab Notes — System Prompt Roles (fwk-001)

Goal
- Validate enablement and routing for all roles under `frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt`.

Setup
- Files:
  - `rules_master_toggle.mdc` — role enablement + command routing
  - `execution_orchestrator.mdc` — pipeline stages, gates, handoffs, states
  - Role files: `product_owner_ai.mdc`, `planning_ai.mdc`, `codegen_ai.mdc`, `qa_ai.mdc`, `mlops_ai.mdc`, `observability_ai.mdc`, `documentation_ai.mdc`, `analyst_ai.mdc`, `memory_ai.mdc`, `auditor_ai.mdc`, `principal_engineer_ai.mdc`, `prompt_factory_ai.mdc`, `framework_memory_bridge.mdc`

Steps
1) Verify role enablement (spot-check disabled→enabled):
```bash
sed -n '1,140p' frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/rules_master_toggle.mdc | cat
```
2) Verify routing matrix has expected commands:
```bash
sed -n '120,180p' frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/rules_master_toggle.mdc | cat
```
3) Verify gates enabled and required inputs in orchestrator:
```bash
sed -n '70,110p' frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/execution_orchestrator.mdc | cat
```
4) Handoffs (audit→validation→synthesis) present:
```bash
sed -n '220,248p' frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/system-prompt/execution_orchestrator.mdc | cat
```

Results
- Role enablement: EXPECT `enabled: true` for auditor_ai and principal_engineer_ai, as well as support roles toggled as needed.
- Routing matrix: commands mapped to roles as documented.
- Gates: `audit_gate`, `verification_gate`, `synthesis_gate` set to `enabled: true` with proper inputs.
- Handoffs: planning_ai → auditor_ai → principal_engineer_ai → codegen_ai sequence confirmed.

Findings
- Config matches intended orchestration; roles and gates are active; routing matrix is defined.

Next Logical Step
- PASS → Run slice tests per `labnotes/router.md`, `labnotes/memory.md`, `labnotes/pipeline.md` sequentially and flip slices only after PASS.
