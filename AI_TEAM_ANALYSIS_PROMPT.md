# AI TEAM SYSTEM ANALYSIS PROMPT
# Purpose : Analyze sophisticated solo developer system
#           and provide guidance for AI team integration
# Author  : Based on HaymayndzAI system analysis
# Usage   : For AI analysis of freelancer workflow optimization

SYSTEM_ACTION: "ANALYZE_FREELANCER_AI_TEAM_INTEGRATION"
CONTEXT:
  developer_profile: "Solo freelancer planning AI team workflow"
  existing_system: "Sophisticated self-developed task/memory management"
  goal: "Role-based AI specialization for freelancer operations"
  current_challenge: "Blocking rules preventing smooth workflow"
  
DISCOVERED_ASSETS:
  proven_components:
    - task_command_center.py (583 lines) - Interactive control hub
    - workflow_memory_intelligence_fixed.py (1950 lines) - AI workflow engine
    - todo_manager.py (766 lines) - Hierarchical task management
    - memory-bank/ structure - Complete memory persistence
    - auto_sync_manager.py - State synchronization with PH timezone
    - cursor_memory_bridge.py - Session persistence
    - .cursor/rules/ (25+ files) - Advanced rule system with triggers
    
  workflow_patterns:
    - Trigger-based interaction (not GUI-based)
    - Memory-first approach with JSON SOT
    - Phase-based task execution
    - Auto-sync on state changes
    - Philippines timezone normalization
    - Hierarchical TODO structure with command execution

ANALYSIS_REQUIREMENTS:
  1. WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION GUIDANCE:
     • Identify which existing components should be preserved vs enhanced
     • Suggest integration points for role-based AI specialization
     • Recommend trigger command structure for AI team roles
     • Propose memory interaction patterns for role coordination

  2. FREELANCER-SPECIFIC AI ROLES:
     • Design roles specifically for solo freelancer needs:
       - Client management and communication
       - Project estimation and proposal generation
       - Technical architecture for small-medium projects
       - Code generation with freelancer best practices
       - Quality assurance for client deliverables
       - Business operations (invoicing, time tracking)
       - Learning and skill development
     • Each role should have clear triggers, inputs, outputs
     • Avoid enterprise complexity, focus on solo efficiency

  3. BLOCKING RULE ANALYSIS:
     • Identify rules causing workflow friction
     • Suggest simplification strategies (warnings vs blocks)
     • Recommend gate policies for solo work vs team work
     • Propose conflict resolution for overlapping validations

  4. MEMORY SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT:
     • Analyze existing memory-bank structure effectiveness
     • Suggest role-specific memory domains
     • Recommend AI-to-user interaction optimization
     • Propose learning mechanisms from project history

  5. INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
     • Provide guidance on preserving existing investment
     • Suggest gradual migration vs complete overhaul
     • Recommend testing approaches for hybrid system
     • Propose rollback strategies if integration fails

CONSTRAINTS:
  preserve_existing: true     # Don't break working system
  solo_optimized: true       # Focus on single developer efficiency  
  trigger_based: true        # Maintain trigger interaction pattern
  memory_first: true         # Preserve memory-centric approach
  philippines_context: true  # Maintain timezone and local context

OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS:
  format: "structured_guidance_document"
  sections:
    - "System Preservation Strategy"
    - "AI Role Design Guidelines" 
    - "Trigger Command Architecture"
    - "Memory Integration Patterns"
    - "Implementation Roadmap"
    - "Risk Mitigation Strategies"
  
  guidance_style: "advisory_recommendations"
  avoid: "specific_code_solutions"
  include: "decision_frameworks_and_principles"
  
ANALYSIS_DEPTH: "comprehensive_but_actionable"
LANGUAGE: "English with Filipino context understanding"
TONE: "Professional advisory for experienced developer"
