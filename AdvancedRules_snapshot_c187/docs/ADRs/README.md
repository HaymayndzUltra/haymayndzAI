# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the AdvancedRules framework.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context, consequences, and implementation status. They serve as a historical record of why certain technical decisions were made.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown
# [ADR-XXX] [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local]

## Decision
[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context after applying the decision]

## Implementation
[Describe how the decision was implemented]

## Notes
[Additional context, references, or considerations]
```

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](./001-framework-architecture.md) | Framework Architecture | Accepted | [Date] |
| [ADR-002](./002-ai-persona-coordination.md) | AI Persona Coordination | Proposed | [Date] |
| [ADR-003](./003-memory-management.md) | Memory Management Strategy | Proposed | [Date] |

## Creating New ADRs

1. **Identify the Decision**: Determine if a decision warrants an ADR
2. **Create the File**: Use the template above in a new markdown file
3. **Number the ADR**: Use the next sequential number
4. **Update Index**: Add the new ADR to this README
5. **Review Process**: Have the Principal Engineer AI review the ADR
6. **Implementation**: Update the ADR status as implementation progresses

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:
- **Architecture Patterns**: Choice of architectural styles or patterns
- **Technology Selection**: Selection of frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Data Models**: Database design and data structure decisions
- **Integration Patterns**: How systems communicate and integrate
- **Security Decisions**: Security architecture and implementation choices
- **Performance Strategies**: Performance optimization and scaling decisions

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial proposal for architectural decision
2. **Under Review**: Decision is being evaluated and discussed
3. **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and will be implemented
4. **Implemented**: Decision has been implemented in the system
5. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant or has been replaced
6. **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Simple**: Focus on the decision and its rationale
- **Be Specific**: Include concrete details about the decision
- **Consider Alternatives**: Document why other options were rejected
- **Update Regularly**: Keep ADRs current with implementation status
- **Link Related ADRs**: Reference related decisions and dependencies

## Review Process

All ADRs should be reviewed by:
1. **Principal Engineer AI**: Technical feasibility and alignment
2. **Security AI**: Security implications and considerations
3. **Product Owner AI**: Business impact and alignment
4. **Team Members**: Implementation feasibility and concerns
