      # Demo Playbook (Goal-Level)
      Duration: 5–10 minutes
      Objective: Ipakita ang outcome, hindi implementation details.

      ## Flow
      1) Context (30s): Ano ang problema at desired outcome
      2) Inputs (30s): Sample data / prompt / endpoint
      3) Run (3–5m): Live run ng minimal path
      4) Result (1m): Outcome, metrics, acceptance criteria
      5) Next Steps (30s): Ano ang susunod kung go-signal

      ## Success Criteria
      - Deterministic steps (repeatable)
      - Walang manual patching sa git
      - Clear pass/fail signals

      ## Notes
      - Avoid tech deep-dives; focus sa outcomes.
