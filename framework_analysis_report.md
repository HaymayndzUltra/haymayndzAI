### Executive Summary

- The INPUT_FILE is a minimal context snapshot (timestamp, brief summary, empty open questions and next steps, a single tag) and contains no roles, stages, or procedural definitions.
- Critical governance elements are absent: client intake, human approvals, feedback loops, and formal closure/knowledge transfer.
- Ambiguities include the meaning of "BL-007", the criteria behind "Validated", the lifecycle and semantics of the `always_hot` tag, and how empty sections are interpreted.
- Recommendations focus on introducing a minimal schema (roles, gates, feedback, closure), ownership, and acceptance signals to enable auditability and reduce ambiguity.

### 1) Potential Overlaps & Redundancies

- No roles or stages are defined; overlap analysis is not possible with this INPUT_FILE alone. Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`, `L3-L3: open_questions: []`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []`, `L5-L5: tags:`, `L6-L6: - always_hot`.

Role | Responsibility | Evidence (line refs)
--- | --- | ---
Unspecified (no roles defined) | N/A in INPUT_FILE | `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`, `L3-L3: open_questions: []`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []`, `L5-L5: tags:`, `L6-L6: - always_hot`

### 2) Identified Gaps & Missing Processes

- Client brief intake & requirement clarification BEFORE PLANNING: Not represented. Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`, `L3-L3: open_questions: []`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []` (no intake/requirements section).
- Explicit human-in-the-loop approvals (who/when/what blocks): Not represented. Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`, `L3-L3: open_questions: []`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []` (no approval fields).
- Client feedback loops during/after development: Not represented. Evidence: `L3-L3: open_questions: []`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []` (no feedback entries/states).
- Formal project closure & knowledge transfer (handover, sign-off): Not represented. Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []` (no closure/KT artifacts).
- Role definitions and responsibility matrix (e.g., RACI): Not represented. Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`, `L5-L5: tags:`, `L6-L6: - always_hot` (no roles/responsibilities fields).
- Lifecycle stage/status field and transitions: Not represented. Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop` (no stage/status present).
- Change history/audit trail beyond timestamp: Not represented. Evidence: `L1-L1: ts: '2025-08-25T20:51:59Z'` (single timestamp only; no version/author/event log).
- Risk/issues log separate from questions: Not represented. Evidence: `L3-L3: open_questions: []` (no risks/issues severity/state).

### 3) Points of Ambiguity

- What is "BL-007" and what constitutes the "memory loop"? Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`. Why it matters: Without a defined artifact ID taxonomy and scope, traceability and replication are impossible.
- What "Validated" means (criteria, tests, approver)? Evidence: `L2-L2: summary: Validated BL-007 memory loop`. Why it matters: Validation without criteria/owner undermines quality gates and auditability.
- How to interpret empty sections: are there truly no open questions/next steps, or are they unknown/unspecified? Evidence: `L3-L3: open_questions: []`, `L4-L4: next_steps: []`. Why it matters: Empty vs. explicitly "none" conveys different risk/posture; driving different actions.
- Semantics and lifecycle of `always_hot` tag (owner, TTL, scope, eviction policy). Evidence: `L5-L5: tags:`, `L6-L6: - always_hot`. Why it matters: Tag drives prioritization/retention but lacks governance, risking misuse or staleness.
- Timestamp usage and staleness policy (is `Z` UTC normalized, what SLA/TTL?). Evidence: `L1-L1: ts: '2025-08-25T20:51:59Z'`. Why it matters: Decisions require freshness guarantees and consistent clocks.

### 4) Strategic Recommendations

- Define and adopt a minimal schema for framework records (v1)
  - Owner: Architecture Owner
  - Trigger: Before any planning/execution artifact is created or updated
  - Action: Add fields: `roles[]`, `responsibilities[]`, `status`, `stage`, `approvals[]`, `feedback[]`, `closure{handover, sign_off}`, `changelog[]`
  - Acceptance signal: New records validate against schema; existing records migrated
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: High / M / Depends on schema consensus

- Introduce role definitions with RACI mapping
  - Owner: Product Owner + Engineering Lead
  - Trigger: Immediately after schema v1 is approved
  - Action: Enumerate roles and map responsibilities to stages/gates
  - Acceptance signal: Table of Role→Responsibility exists and is referenced by records
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: High / S / Depends on schema v1

- Implement explicit approval gates with audit fields
  - Owner: Delivery/Program Manager
  - Trigger: On every stage transition to "Validated" or equivalent
  - Action: Capture `approved_by`, `approved_on (UTC)`, `gate`, `evidence_ref`
  - Acceptance signal: No "Validated" status without a populated approval entry
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: High / S / Depends on status/stage fields

- Establish client feedback capture and linkage
  - Owner: Product Owner
  - Trigger: After demos, milestones, releases
  - Action: Add `feedback[]` with `source`, `date`, `sentiment`, `actionable`, `linked_items`
  - Acceptance signal: Each milestone record has ≥1 feedback item or explicit "none"
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: Medium / S / Depends on schema v1

- Add formal closure and knowledge transfer checklist
  - Owner: Delivery/Program Manager
  - Trigger: Prior to release closure or handover
  - Action: Require `handover_docs`, `runbooks`, `sign_off{by,on}` fields
  - Acceptance signal: Release cannot close without completed closure object
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: High / S / Depends on schema v1

- Add lifecycle `status` and `stage` with allowed transitions
  - Owner: Engineering Lead
  - Trigger: With schema v1 rollout
  - Action: Enumerate states and transitions; enforce via validation
  - Acceptance signal: All records carry valid `status`/`stage`; invalid transitions blocked
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: High / S / Depends on schema v1

- Govern tag taxonomy and TTL for `always_hot`
  - Owner: Architecture Owner
  - Trigger: With tagging policy adoption
  - Action: Define allowed tags, ownership, TTL, and eviction policy
  - Acceptance signal: Tag usage aligns with policy; stale tags auto-flagged/removed
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: Medium / S / None

- Add changelog/audit trail
  - Owner: Engineering Lead
  - Trigger: On each record mutation
  - Action: Append `changelog[]` entries: `who`, `when (UTC)`, `what`, `why`
  - Acceptance signal: Each record has an append-only audit history
  - Impact/Effort/Dependencies: High / M / Depends on storage format

## Code & Rules-Informed Addendum (v2)

### Executive Addendum Summary

The repository’s `.cursor/rules` and `src/` implementations provide a far richer picture than the lone `context_snapshot.yaml`.  Many governance mechanisms (pipeline graph, gate rules, atomic writes, single-writer policies) already exist in rules and code.  However, key **implementation gaps** remain: task schema lacks approval / gate / handoff fields; orchestrator state artifacts (`workflow_state.json`, `gate_results.json`) are absent; and no runtime handler exists for `/run_pipeline` commands or `role_timeout → ESCALATE` logic.

### 1) Alignment Matrix — Rules vs. Code

| Requirement (Rule) | Code Evidence | Status |
|--------------------|---------------|--------|
| Pipeline graph with ordered roles | `L34-L36: A[product_owner_ai] --> B[planning_ai] ...` (`.cursor/rules/execution_orchestrator.mdc`) | RULE-DEFINED ✅ (graph present) |
| Gate definitions & blocking conditions | `L97-L124` same file (planning, code_generation, QA, deployment gates) | RULE-DEFINED ✅ (rules only) |
| Atomic writes & file locking for state | `L37-L45: def atomic_write_bytes(... os.replace...)` (`src/repo/atomic_io.py`) | IMPLEMENTED ✅ |
| Single-writer policy for session markdown | `L217-L219: from cursor_memory_bridge import dump_markdown` (`src/repo/auto_sync_manager.py`) | IMPLEMENTED ✅ |
| Task SOT in `tasks_active.json` | `L71-L78` (`memory-bank/queue-system/README.md`) | IMPLEMENTED ✅ |
| Approvals / handoff log fields in task schema | `L1-L8` (`memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json`) shows none | MISSING ❌ |
| Orchestrator state artifacts (`workflow_state.json`, `gate_results.json`) | repo search → not found | MISSING ❌ |
| `/run_pipeline`, `/status`, etc. command handlers | no CLI or module implements | MISSING ❌ |
| Escalation for `role_timeout` | `L228-L231: role_timeout → ESCALATE … human_operator` (rule) but no handler in code | MISSING ❌ |

### 2) Updated Gaps & Missing Processes

1. **State Artifacts Not Materialized**  
   Evidence rule: `L19-L23` (`execution_orchestrator.mdc`) enumerates output artifacts; none exist in repo.
2. **Task Schema Mis-alignment**  
   Evidence code: `L1-L8` (`tasks_active.json`) lacks `approvals[]`, `gate_results`, `handoff_log` required by rules (`L310-L314`).
3. **Command Execution Layer Absent**  
   Rule commands (`L25-L30`, `/run_pipeline`, `/status`) have no implementation under `src/`.
4. **Error Escalation Logic Missing**  
   Rule (`L228-L231`) specifies `role_timeout → ESCALATE → human_operator`; no code paths implement notification or blocking.

### 3) Strategic Recommendations (Updated)

ID | Recommendation | Impact | Effort | Dependencies
---|----------------|--------|--------|-------------
R1 | **Implement orchestrator state persistence** (`workflow_state.json`, `gate_results.json`, `handoff_log.json`) with atomic writes & locks | High | M | atomic_io.py
R2 | **Extend task JSON schema** to include `approvals[]`, `gate_results[]`, `handoff_ref` aligning with rule specs | High | S | R1
R3 | **Create CLI / module `pipeline_cli.py`** to handle `/run_pipeline`, `/status`, `/halt`, `/resume` commands, updating orchestrator state | High | M | R1
R4 | **Add escalation handler** for `role_timeout` that logs, blocks pipeline, and writes notification to `alerts/` | Medium | S | R1
R5 | **Back-fill existing tasks** in `tasks_active.json` & `tasks_queue.json` with new schema fields (default empty arrays) | Medium | S | R2
