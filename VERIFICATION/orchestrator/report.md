Status: PASS

### Execution Orchestrator — Verification Report

Scope: Define allowed transitions, guards, entry/exit artifacts, recovery paths for the pipeline:
IDLE → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → TESTING → DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING (BLOCKED/ROLLBACK as recovery)

#### Sources

## Rationale
- All states declare entry/exit criteria and produced artifacts (Section 1, plus states[] in findings.json).
- Transition table enumerates allowed transitions; no undocumented transitions (acceptance_check.no_undocumented_transitions=true).
- Recovery flows documented (BLOCKED/ROLLBACK) with artifacts and exit criteria (Section 3).
- Gate guards map to required inputs and validation rules (planning/codegen/QA/deployment gates).
- Critical transitions coverage target declared (0.9) for test planning.

### 1) Workflow States — Entry/Exit Criteria and Artifacts

- IDLE
  - Entry: No active pipeline
  - Exit: Start request accepted; `product_backlog.yaml` present
  - Entry Artifacts: none
  - Produced Artifacts: `workflow_state.json`
  - Transitions: IDLE → PLANNING (guard: backlog present)

- PLANNING
  - Entry: From IDLE; `product_backlog.yaml`
  - Guards: planning_gate passes; no blocking conditions
  - Exit: `technical_plan.md` approved; `task_breakdown.yaml`, `acceptance_criteria.json` ready
  - Entry Artifacts: `product_backlog.yaml`
  - Produced Artifacts: `technical_plan.md`, `task_breakdown.yaml`, `acceptance_criteria.json`
  - Transitions: PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT (guard: planning_gate = PASS); PLANNING → BLOCKED (gate failure, timeout, dependency failure)

- DEVELOPMENT
  - Entry: From PLANNING; `technical_plan.md`, `task_breakdown.yaml`
  - Guards: code_generation_gate passes
  - Exit: `source_code`, `unit_tests`, `documentation` present
  - Entry Artifacts: `technical_plan.md`, `task_breakdown.yaml`
  - Produced Artifacts: `source_code`, `unit_tests`, `documentation`
  - Transitions: DEVELOPMENT → TESTING (guard: code_generation_gate validation satisfied); DEVELOPMENT → BLOCKED (compilation_errors, missing_tests, timeout/dependency failure)

- TESTING
  - Entry: From DEVELOPMENT; `source_code`, `unit_tests`, `acceptance_criteria.json`
  - Guards: quality_assurance_gate passes; no blocking conditions
  - Exit: `validated_code`; all tests pass (≥90%); no critical vulns; perf met
  - Entry Artifacts: `source_code`, `unit_tests`, `acceptance_criteria.json`
  - Produced Artifacts: `validated_code`, `test_report.json`, `coverage_report.json`, `security_scan_report.json`, `performance_report.json`
  - Transitions: TESTING → DEPLOYMENT (guard: QA PASS); TESTING → DEVELOPMENT (test_failures); TESTING → BLOCKED (security_issues/performance_degradation/timeout)

- DEPLOYMENT
  - Entry: From TESTING; `validated_code`, `deployment_config`, `rollback_plan.md`, `monitoring_config.yaml`
  - Guards: deployment_gate passes; no blocking conditions
  - Exit: Health checks pass; monitoring configured
  - Produced Artifacts: `deployment_logs.txt`, `release_version.txt`, `monitoring_config.yaml`
  - Transitions: DEPLOYMENT → MONITORING (PASS); DEPLOYMENT → ROLLBACK (failed_health_checks | critical_error)

- MONITORING
  - Entry: From DEPLOYMENT; monitoring configured
  - Exit: Release accepted (stability window) or incident declared
  - Entry Artifacts: `monitoring_config.yaml`
  - Produced Artifacts: `post_deploy_report.md`, `observability_metrics.json`, `incidents.jsonl`
  - Transitions: MONITORING → IDLE (release accepted)

- BLOCKED (recovery)
  - Entry: Gate failure, dependency failure fallback, manual halt, or stuck-state escalation
  - Exit: Root cause fixed; re-validate prior state exit OR abort
  - Entry Artifacts: `block_reason.txt`
  - Produced Artifacts: `unblock_notes.md`
  - Transitions: BLOCKED → previous_state (after fix); BLOCKED → IDLE (abort)

- ROLLBACK (recovery)
  - Entry: From DEPLOYMENT on critical_error or failed health checks
  - Exit: Previous stable version restored; health checks pass
  - Entry Artifacts: `rollback_plan.md`, `previous_release_metadata.json`
  - Produced Artifacts: `rollback_report.md`, `restored_version.txt`
  - Transitions: ROLLBACK → IDLE

---

### 2) Transition Guards (Gate Rules)

- planning_gate
  - Required: `product_backlog.yaml`
  - Validate: user stories acceptance criteria; complete technical plan; dependencies identified
  - Blockers: `missing_requirements`, `invalid_architecture`

- code_generation_gate
  - Required: `technical_plan.md`, `task_breakdown.yaml`
  - Validate: style compliance; unit tests; documentation present
  - Blockers: `compilation_errors`, `missing_tests`

- quality_assurance_gate
  - Required: `source_code`, `acceptance_criteria.json`
  - Validate: tests pass (≥90%); no critical vulns; performance met
  - Blockers: `test_failures`, `security_issues`, `performance_degradation`

- deployment_gate
  - Required: `validated_code`, `deployment_config`
  - Validate: health checks pass; rollback ready; monitoring configured
  - Blockers: `failed_health_checks`, `missing_monitoring`

---

### 3) Recovery & Stuck-State Policies

- BLOCKED
  - Actions: manual_intervention, retry, rollback (if applicable)
  - Transitions: `previous_state` (after fix, re-validate exit), or `IDLE` (abort)
  - Policy: require root cause, require `unblock_notes.md`, revalidate previous exit criteria

- ROLLBACK
  - Trigger: `critical_error`, `failed_health_checks`
  - Checks: restored env passes health checks
  - Transition: `IDLE` when stable

- Timeouts & Heartbeats
  - role_timeout: 30m; dependency_failure max wait: 60m; heartbeat interval: 5m; escalate after 6 misses
  - On heartbeat miss: escalate to human_operator; unresolved → BLOCKED

- Idempotent Re-entry & Crash/Restart
  - Re-entry: validate required artifacts; compare content hashes; skip already satisfied steps
  - Crash/Restart: reload checkpoint; verify partials; inconsistencies → BLOCKED

---

### 4) Transition Table (Extract)

Refer to `VERIFICATION/orchestrator/findings.json` → `transition_table` for the full matrix, including required inputs, outputs, guards, and on-failure next states.

---

### 5) Risks / Edge Cases

- Partial completion ambiguity → only commit exits on PASS; hash/timestamp checks
- Missing artifacts in TESTING → enforce entry checks; bounce to BLOCKED/DEVELOPMENT
- Crash/restart replay → checkpoint-driven, idempotent re-entry; discrepancies → BLOCKED

---

### 6) Acceptance Criteria Check

- All states have defined entry/exit criteria and artifacts: YES
- No undocumented transitions: YES (see findings.json transition_table)
- Rollback/resume documented: YES (BLOCKED and ROLLBACK policies)
- Coverage target for critical transitions (≥90% planned tests): TARGET SET in findings.json (`critical_transitions_coverage_target: 0.9`)
