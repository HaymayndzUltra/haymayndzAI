# Final_Implementation_Plan.md

## 1. Objectives & Scope
- Execute the phased testing/validation plan defined in `Action_Plan.md` (AP L1–L79) with additions (AP L80–L86).
- Mitigate validated risks from `Summary_Report.md` (SR §2) and `Validation_Report.md` (VR §2–§4), including NEW-RISK-001…006.
- Produce measurable, repeatable outcomes with explicit entrance/exit gates and rollback.

## 2. Assumptions Acknowledged & Constraints
- Assumptions: SR §4 A-001…A-010. Fragility mitigations embedded in tasks.
- Constraints: CI runners are Linux; network FS may be present; non-interactive execution required for CI; toolchain versions must be pinned for reproducibility.

## 4. Execution Phases

### Phase A — Planning & Controls
- Entrance: Repo available; stakeholders assigned.
- Tasks: T-001, T-002, T-003, T-004, T-005, T-006, T-011, T-014, T-022, T-013.
- Exit: Toolchain pinned; RBAC/secrets/isolation/waiver policies approved; env var validation merged; planner-first CI bypass configured; staging env defined.

### Phase B — Core Foundations
- Entrance: Phase A exit met.
- Tasks: T-015, T-016, T-017, T-018, T-019.
- Exit: Command surface, role deps, routing, hydration, and observability checks passing locally and in CI.

### Phase C — Reliability & Safety
- Entrance: Phase B exit met.
- Tasks: T-012, T-020, T-021, T-023.
- Exit: Idempotent gates with rollback checkpoints; security gates with waiver governance; concurrency tests stable; rollback rehearsal validated.

### Phase D — Performance & Scale
- Entrance: Phase C exit met.
- Tasks: T-006, T-008, T-025.
- Exit: Perf methodology adopted; stress tests added; duration SLAs codified and green.

### Phase E — Deployment & Docs Isolation
- Entrance: Phase D exit met.
- Tasks: T-004, T-013, T-024.
- Exit: Isolated staging used for deployment checks; docs/analysis isolation prevents pipeline races.

## 5. Rollback & Recovery Playbooks
- Global Checkpoints: After each gate (Backlog, Plan, Gen Code, Test, Audit, Peer Review, Synthesis, Deploy), create atomic snapshot with RPO/RTO metrics.
- Rollback Triggers: Gate failure, severe security findings without waiver, concurrency deadlocks, health check failures.
- Steps: Quiesce runners → capture diffs → restore last green snapshot → verify health SLIs → re-run failed gate with increased verbosity.

## 6. Risk-to-Task Mapping

- NEW-RISK-003 → T-001
- NEW-RISK-004 → T-008
- NEW-RISK-005 → T-009
- NEW-RISK-006 → T-010

## 7. Observability & Validation
- Metrics: Gate pass/fail counts, rollback frequency, test duration percentiles, top-10 slow tests, lock contention incidents, waiver approvals/expiries.
- Alerts: Gate failure with missing rollback checkpoint; security block without waiver; planner-first confirmation required in CI; routing drift beyond threshold.
- QA Gates: Phase exit criteria above; require green CI across Linux runners; reproducible within 3 consecutive runs.
