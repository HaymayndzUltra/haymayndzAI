# Validation_Report.md

## 1. Scope & Context (detected plan type/intent)
- Detected Plan Type: Operational/Execution testing and validation plan across phased gates (Foundational → Workflow/Integration → Robustness/Advanced).
- Inputs Reviewed: `Action_Plan.md` (AP L1–L86) and `Summary_Report.md` (SR §1–§9).
- Context Confirmation: Phases and expected outcomes are clearly defined in AP L1–L79; additions/notes captured in AP L80–L86. SR §1 correctly characterizes scope and intent.

## 2. Validated Findings

| Risk ID | Decision | Rationale | Evidence Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-001 | CONFIRM | Baseline drift between effective routing and baseline is a credible failure mode that would mask regressions. | AP L5; SR §2 R-001 |
| R-002 | CONFIRM | Large command surface listed; absence or stubbing of any command will break flows. | AP L4; SR §2 R-002 |
| R-003 | CONFIRM | Dependencies across roles must be enforced deterministically to avoid inconsistent outcomes. | AP L6–L9, L31–L34; SR §2 R-003 |
| R-004 | CONFIRM | Tight perf thresholds (<2ms/<5ms) are environment-sensitive and risk flakiness without fixture control. | AP L13; SR §2 R-004 |
| R-005 | CHALLENGE | `KeyError` on unknown type is specified behavior for tests; not inherently "over-brittle" if error messaging/exit codes are asserted. | AP L17; SR §2 R-005 |
| R-006 | CONFIRM | Gate enforcement without explicit rollback/idempotency can yield partial artifacts and divergent reruns. | AP L33, L38; SR §2 R-006 |
| R-007 | CONFIRM | Deployment/health validations lack explicit environment isolation and may hit shared targets. | AP L41–L42; SR §2 R-007 |
| R-008 | CONFIRM | Memory bridge relies on `MEMORY_STORAGE_ROOT`; misconfigurations can desync storage. | AP L49–L50; SR §2 R-008 |
| R-009 | CONFIRM | Concurrent index/lock operations on shared FS can deadlock or corrupt without robust primitives. | AP L53–L54; SR §2 R-009 |
| R-010 | CONFIRM | Duration SLAs lack explicit numeric targets and measurement method, risking inconsistent pass/fail. | AP L66–L67; SR §2 R-010 |
| R-011 | CONFIRM | Security gates block on findings; absence of waiver/exception policy can deadlock pipelines. | AP L70–L71; SR §2 R-011 |
| R-012 | CONFIRM | Planner-first confirmations can stall CI unless non-interactive bypass is defined. | AP L74–L75; SR §2 R-012 |
| R-013 | CONFIRM | Rollback rehearsals may mutate state; idempotency and full restoration must be proven. | AP L76–L79; SR §2 R-013 |
| R-014 | CONFIRM | Doc/analysis regeneration during pipelines can race with artifact reads/writes. | AP L45–L46; SR §2 R-014 |

## 3. Contested Findings (details + evidence)

- R-005: Path resolution error handling may be over-brittle
  - Decision: CHALLENGE
  - Rationale: The plan explicitly expects a `KeyError` for non-existent types (AP L17) as part of negative testing. This is acceptable if surfaced with a deterministic exit code and clear message, and if tests assert on those. The brittleness concern is addressed by ensuring user-facing CLI wraps internal exceptions into structured diagnostics.
  - Evidence: AP L14–L17 specify negative-case behavior; SR §2 R-005.
  - Recommendation: Require tests to assert error type, message, and exit code; add a CLI-level handler translating `KeyError` into a stable error schema.

## 4. New Risks

- NEW-RISK-001 (High): Missing RBAC/permissions model for command execution
  - Evidence: No RBAC/authorization semantics mentioned across AP L1–L86.
  - Impact: Unauthorized or accidental execution of privileged commands in shared environments.

- NEW-RISK-002 (High): Secrets management and sensitive artifact handling not specified
  - Evidence: No handling for credentials/tokens or redaction in artifacts (AP L1–L86).
  - Impact: Leakage of secrets into logs/artifacts; non-compliance.

- NEW-RISK-003 (Medium): Toolchain/version pinning for validators/renderers absent
  - Evidence: Validators (YAML, Mermaid, pytest, Bandit/Safety) referenced without pinning (AP L23–L25, L68–L71).
  - Impact: CI variability due to upstream changes; reproducibility risk.

- NEW-RISK-004 (Medium): Lack of large-scale data volume stress tests beyond schema bounds
  - Evidence: AP L11–L13 covers schema bounds only; no stress/throughput tests.
  - Impact: Performance/latency degradation or OOM under realistic loads.

- NEW-RISK-005 (Medium): Audit logging integrity and tamper evidence not covered
  - Evidence: AP L23–L25 validate format/render only; no integrity/tamper checks.
  - Impact: Forensic gaps; inability to trust audit trail.

- NEW-RISK-006 (Low): Time synchronization and ordering guarantees for handoff logs unspecified
  - Evidence: AP L34 requires expected transitions but not monotonic clocks/ordering.
  - Impact: Ambiguous sequencing under distributed runners; flaky assertions.

## 5. Coverage Summary
- Validated: All SR §2 risks R-001…R-014 against AP references. Confirmed scope/intent (SR §1). Traceability map aligns (SR §8).
- Not Applicable/Not Assessed: Runtime implementation quality of referenced tools/CLIs (out of document scope); numeric thresholds from external configs not present in AP.
- Gaps: Measurement methodology for performance/health checks remains unspecified; environment isolation and waiver policy require definition.

## 6. Verdict
- Risk report largely validated with one contested finding (R-005) and six new risks identified (NEW-RISK-001…006). Proceed to synthesis with mitigations incorporated, especially around RBAC, secrets, environment isolation, waiver governance, and reproducible toolchains.
