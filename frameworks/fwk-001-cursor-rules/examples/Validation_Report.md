## Verification and Extended Risk Analysis

- **Findings verification**
  - **Gate enforcement contradiction: Confirmed.** `frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/.../execution_orchestrator.mdc` encodes BLOCK semantics on gate failure, while `/.cursor/rules/phase_gates.mdc` labels gates as “optional” and explicitly allows `todo_manager.py exec`/`done` anytime. Impact stated (policy drift) is correct.
  - **Analysis policy mismatch: Confirmed.** `/.cursor/rules/deep_analysis.mdc` positions analysis as advisory (“execution can proceed regardless”), while `todo_manager.py` defaults to BLOCK unless `AI_ENFORCEMENT_MODE∈{solo, optional, warn, advisory}`. The reported default (“team” → block) is correct, and the Impact is accurate.

- **Deeper systemic risks**
  - **Developer confusion**
    - Docs encourage proceeding; CLI blocks by default. Leads to “works on my machine” vs “blocked in CI” when env differs.
    - Silent behavior drift via environment (`AI_ENFORCEMENT_MODE`) makes outcomes shell/host-dependent.
  - **Operational friction**
    - Inconsistent gates across contributors slow PR cycles and increase handoffs.
    - Non-deterministic execution order if some bypass gates while others follow framework state transitions.
  - **Technical debt**
    - Two policy sources require continuous sync; doc/code drift will regress quickly.
    - Larger test matrix (advisory vs strict) for every path; increases failure modes and maintenance cost.
  - **Governance and audit risk**
    - Ability to downshift to advisory by env var enables gate circumvention; weakens compliance posture.
    - Mixed “state machine” semantics (framework’s BLOCKED state vs legacy optional gates) degrade traceability.
  - **CI/local divergence**
    - Local set to advisory; CI defaults to block → flakiness and surprise failures. Hard to debug due to mode-dependent logs.
  - **Onboarding friction**
    - New contributors follow `/.cursor/rules` and form incorrect mental models, then hit BLOCK downstream; trust erosion.
