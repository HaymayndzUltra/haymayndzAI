## Validation Report — Peer Review

### 1) Scope & Context (detected plan type/intent)
- **Plan Title**: 
- **Type/Intent**: Operational/Execution — integrate governance/config artifacts into the framework

### 2) Validated Findings
| Risk ID | Decision (CONFIRM/CHALLENGE) | Rationale | Evidence Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-001 | CONFIRM | Only `framework_contract_framework1.mdc` declares ordering; others lack readiness/order. | ```1:6:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
artifact_schema.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — no uniform frontmatter/sidecar schema exists; adds consistent metadata (ids, versions, status) for orchestrator and linting without conflicting with current gates or routing.
artifact_routing.mdc	Integrate (ensure naming separation from command routing)	Enhancement — current rules_master_toggle.mdc routes commands only; deterministic artifact path mapping is missing. Keep artifact routing artifacts separate from routing_matrix.json to avoid confusion.
artifact_sync_rules.mdc	Integrate (orchestrator single-writer)	Enhancement — introduces artifacts_index.json with checksums/versioning/history. Aligns with orchestrator’s single-writer model; complements memory-bridge sync without overlap.
hydration_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — defines input selection/precedence (approved → latest non-draft → solo) per stage to prevent drift; not present in current framework; compatible with gate inputs.
framework_contract_framework1.mdc	Integrate (after schema/routing/hydration)	Enhancement — formalizes per-framework allowed artifacts and draft→review→approved save rules, complementing examples and gates; defer until base schema/routing/hydration are in place to avoid duplication.
promotion_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — adds lifecycle governance (promotion tags, snapshots, rollback) tied to gate PASS; currently absent and aligns with safety/traceability goals.
``` |
| R-002 | CONFIRM | Single-writer/index semantics imply integrity/concurrency risks. | ```3:3:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
artifact_sync_rules.mdc	Integrate (orchestrator single-writer)	Enhancement — introduces artifacts_index.json with checksums/versioning/history. Aligns with orchestrator’s single-writer model; complements memory-bridge sync without overlap.
``` |
| R-003 | CONFIRM | Separation of artifact vs command routing is ambiguous and risks drift. | ```2:2:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
artifact_routing.mdc	Integrate (ensure naming separation from command routing)	Enhancement — current rules_master_toggle.mdc routes commands only; deterministic artifact path mapping is missing. Keep artifact routing artifacts separate from routing_matrix.json to avoid confusion.
``` |
| R-004 | CONFIRM | Hydration precedence lacks explicit tie-breakers; validator flagged missing determinism. | ```4:4:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
hydration_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — defines input selection/precedence (approved → latest non-draft → solo) per stage to prevent drift; not present in current framework; compatible with gate inputs.
``` |
| R-005 | CONFIRM | Promotion references snapshots/rollback without provenance/retention specifics. | ```6:6:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
promotion_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — adds lifecycle governance (promotion tags, snapshots, rollback) tied to gate PASS; currently absent and aligns with safety/traceability goals.
``` |
| R-006 | CONFIRM | Missing governance fields (owner/status/acceptance/timeline/SLOs) across entries. | ```1:6:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
