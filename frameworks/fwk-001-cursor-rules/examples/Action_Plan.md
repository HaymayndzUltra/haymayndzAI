artifact_schema.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — no uniform frontmatter/sidecar schema exists; adds consistent metadata (ids, versions, status) for orchestrator and linting without conflicting with current gates or routing.
artifact_routing.mdc	Integrate (ensure naming separation from command routing)	Enhancement — current rules_master_toggle.mdc routes commands only; deterministic artifact path mapping is missing. Keep artifact routing artifacts separate from routing_matrix.json to avoid confusion.
artifact_sync_rules.mdc	Integrate (orchestrator single-writer)	Enhancement — introduces artifacts_index.json with checksums/versioning/history. Aligns with orchestrator’s single-writer model; complements memory-bridge sync without overlap.
hydration_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — defines input selection/precedence (approved → latest non-draft → solo) per stage to prevent drift; not present in current framework; compatible with gate inputs.
framework_contract_framework1.mdc	Integrate (after schema/routing/hydration)	Enhancement — formalizes per-framework allowed artifacts and draft→review→approved save rules, complementing examples and gates; defer until base schema/routing/hydration are in place to avoid duplication.
promotion_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — adds lifecycle governance (promotion tags, snapshots, rollback) tied to gate PASS; currently absent and aligns with safety/traceability goals.
