## Summary Report (Auditor Output)

## 1. Context Summary (type/intent detected)
- **Plan Title**: Not specified
- **Type/Intent**: Operational/Execution — integrate governance/config artifacts into the framework (multiple “Integrate …” actions).

## 2. Critical Risks
- R-001 — Missing end-to-end sequencing and readiness criteria
  - **Evidence/Quote**:
```1:6:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
artifact_schema.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — no uniform frontmatter/sidecar schema exists; adds consistent metadata (ids, versions, status) for orchestrator and linting without conflicting with current gates or routing.
artifact_routing.mdc	Integrate (ensure naming separation from command routing)	Enhancement — current rules_master_toggle.mdc routes commands only; deterministic artifact path mapping is missing. Keep artifact routing artifacts separate from routing_matrix.json to avoid confusion.
artifact_sync_rules.mdc	Integrate (orchestrator single-writer)	Enhancement — introduces artifacts_index.json with checksums/versioning/history. Aligns with orchestrator’s single-writer model; complements memory-bridge sync without overlap.
hydration_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — defines input selection/precedence (approved → latest non-draft → solo) per stage to prevent drift; not present in current framework; compatible with gate inputs.
framework_contract_framework1.mdc	Integrate (after schema/routing/hydration)	Enhancement — formalizes per-framework allowed artifacts and draft→review→approved save rules, complementing examples and gates; defer until base schema/routing/hydration are in place to avoid duplication.
promotion_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — adds lifecycle governance (promotion tags, snapshots, rollback) tied to gate PASS; currently absent and aligns with safety/traceability goals.
```
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Affected Steps**: L1–L6
  - **Downstream Impact**: Out-of-order changes can break gates/routing/hydration invariants; unclear prerequisites impede safe rollout and rollback planning.

- R-002 — Data integrity and concurrency risks around artifacts_index.json and single-writer assumptions
  - **Evidence/Quote**:
```3:3:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
artifact_sync_rules.mdc	Integrate (orchestrator single-writer)	Enhancement — introduces artifacts_index.json with checksums/versioning/history. Aligns with orchestrator’s single-writer model; complements memory-bridge sync without overlap.
```
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Affected Steps**: L3
  - **Downstream Impact**: Index corruption on crashes/retries; re-entrancy and lock semantics unspecified; rollback of index state unclear.

- R-003 — Ambiguous separation of artifact vs command routing (risk of drift/duplication)
  - **Evidence/Quote**:
```2:2:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
artifact_routing.mdc	Integrate (ensure naming separation from command routing)	Enhancement — current rules_master_toggle.mdc routes commands only; deterministic artifact path mapping is missing. Keep artifact routing artifacts separate from routing_matrix.json to avoid confusion.
```
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Affected Steps**: L2
  - **Downstream Impact**: Two sources-of-truth (artifact routing vs routing_matrix.json) can diverge; breakage in lookups and auditability.

- R-004 — Non-deterministic hydration precedence and conflict resolution
  - **Evidence/Quote**:
```4:4:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
hydration_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — defines input selection/precedence (approved → latest non-draft → solo) per stage to prevent drift; not present in current framework; compatible with gate inputs.
```
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Affected Steps**: L4
  - **Downstream Impact**: Precedence may still yield ties (e.g., multiple “approved” inputs); unspecified tie-breakers cause nondeterminism and drift.

- R-005 — Lifecycle governance ties to gate PASS without explicit rollback and snapshot provenance
  - **Evidence/Quote**:
```6:6:/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/Action_Plan.md
promotion_rules.mdc	Integrate	Enhancement — adds lifecycle governance (promotion tags, snapshots, rollback) tied to gate PASS; currently absent and aligns with safety/traceability goals.
```
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Affected Steps**: L6
  - **Downstream Impact**: Undefined rollback criteria and snapshot storage/location/integrity can make recovery unreliable after a failed promotion.

- R-006 — Execution feasibility gaps (owners, envs, estimates, acceptance criteria, SLOs)
  - **Evidence/Quote**: L1–L6 (no owners/timelines/acceptance criteria present in entire file)
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Affected Steps**: L1–L6
  - **Downstream Impact**: Orphaned changes, scheduling conflicts, and unverifiable completion; inability to coordinate across frameworks/*.

## 3. Potential Blind Spots
- **B-001 — Migration/backfill for existing artifacts (schema/routing/index)**
  - **Why it matters**: In-place upgrades can invalidate legacy paths; needs compatibility strategy.
- **B-002 — Testing strategy and guardrails (unit/contract/e2e/gate checks)**
  - **Why it matters**: Governance features require strong pre-merge and gate enforcement to avoid regressions.
- **B-003 — Access control and security around new metadata (ids/versions/status, snapshot access)**
  - **Why it matters**: Unauthorized changes or disclosure of internal states.
- **B-004 — Multi-writer or distributed execution scenarios**
  - **Why it matters**: Single-writer assumption may be violated in CI or parallel agents.
- **B-005 — Telemetry/observability for hydration, routing, and promotions**
  - **Why it matters**: Detect drift and diagnose failures quickly.

## 4. Assumptions (explicit/implicit) & fragility
- **A-001 — Orchestrator operates single-writer only**
  - **Fragility**: High — fragile under parallelization.
  - **Evidence**: L3.
- **A-002 — Gates with PASS semantics already exist**
  - **Fragility**: Medium — depends on consistent definitions across frameworks.
  - **Evidence**: L6.
- **A-003 — States draft/review/approved and promotion tagging are standardized**
  - **Fragility**: Medium — requires org-wide alignment.
  - **Evidence**: L5–L6.
- **A-004 — routing_matrix.json remains the canonical command-routing store**
  - **Fragility**: Medium — duplicates increase drift risk.
  - **Evidence**: L2.
- **A-005 — “memory-bridge sync” present and compatible with the new index**
  - **Fragility**: Medium — integration surface not specified.
  - **Evidence**: L3.

## 5. Ambiguities & Measurement Gaps
- **M-001** — “approved → latest non-draft → solo” tie-breakers and determinism not specified. Evidence: L4.
- **M-002** — Snapshot format, retention, sign/verify, and rollback triggers undefined. Evidence: L6.
- **M-003** — Artifact vs command routing precedence rules and conflict detection unclear. Evidence: L2.
- **M-004** — No success metrics (e.g., policy coverage %, drift incidents, MTTR). Evidence: L1–L6 (absence).

## 6. Consistency Issues (within plan & across refs)
- **C-001** — Potential duplication and divergence between artifact routing and routing_matrix.json. Evidence: L2.
- **C-002** — Only one ordered dependency explicitly stated (“after schema/routing/hydration” for framework_contract), others lack ordering; internal consistency of sequencing is weak. Evidence: L1–L6.

## 7. Compliance/Feasibility/Timeline/Scope findings
- **Compliance**: Security/retention for snapshots and metadata not addressed (L6, L1).
- **Feasibility**: No resource/owner/time/rollback rehearsal info (L1–L6).
- **Timeline/Ordering**: Partial ordering only noted for framework_contract; others missing (L5 vs L1–L4, L6).
- **Scope**: References external components (rules_master_toggle.mdc, routing_matrix.json, memory-bridge) without explicit interfaces or version bounds (L2–L3).

## 8. Traceability Map (Risk IDs → Plan refs)
- R-001 → L1–L6
- R-002 → L3
- R-003 → L2
- R-004 → L4
- R-005 → L6
- R-006 → L1–L6
