## 1) Context Summary (type/intent detected)
- Detected Plan Type: Operational/Execution testing and validation plan across phased gates (Foundational → Workflow/Integration → Robustness/Advanced).
- Scope: Validate command routing, role toggling/dependencies, schema/artifact conformance, hydration/routing utilities, workflow gates, deployment/observability, security scanning, memory bridge, concurrency/locking, planner-first mode, and disaster recovery.
- Basis: Phases and expected outcomes explicitly defined in L1–L79; additions documented in L80–L86.

## 2) Critical Risks
- R-001: Command-to-role mapping baseline drift
  - Evidence/Quote: "DOCS/changes/routing_effective.shadow.json aligns with baseline" (L5)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Phase 1 Command Surface Sanity (L2–L5)
  - Downstream Impact: Misaligned baselines can mask routing regressions; false sense of correctness across entire pipeline.

- R-002: Unverified existence/completeness of listed commands
  - Evidence/Quote: "Specific Items to Test: /backlog, /prioritize, ... /planner_mode." (L4)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Phase 1 command surface; Phase 2/3 workflows depending on these commands (L31–L38, L56–L59)
  - Downstream Impact: Missing or stubbed commands cause early termination; incomplete coverage of intended surface.

- R-003: Role dependency enforcement fragility
  - Evidence/Quote: "dependency enforcement for planning_ai → codegen_ai → qa_ai → mlops_ai; optional roles default disabled behavior" (L8)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Role Activation Matrix Integrity (L6–L9), Core Sequential Workflow (L31–L34)
  - Downstream Impact: Non-deterministic outcomes when roles are toggled in different states; false negatives/positives.

- R-004: Performance thresholds potentially unrealistic/under-specified
  - Evidence/Quote: "perf thresholds met (<2ms avg synthetic; <5ms avg real)" (L13)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Schema Conformance validation (L10–L13)
  - Downstream Impact: Flaky failures in CI or heterogeneous environments; performance regressions hidden by variance.

- R-005: Path resolution error handling may be over-brittle
  - Evidence/Quote: "non-existent type raises KeyError" (L17)
  - Severity: Low
  - Affected Steps: Routing Files and Utilities (L14–L17)
  - Downstream Impact: Abrupt failure modes without graceful diagnostics; cascading aborts.

- R-006: Gate enforcement lacks rollback/idempotency guarantees
  - Evidence/Quote: "planning gate must pass before code generation" (L33); "blocking conditions enforced; failure scenarios re-route appropriately" (L38)
  - Severity: High
  - Affected Steps: Core Sequential Workflow and Extended Pipeline (L31–L38)
  - Downstream Impact: Partial artifacts, inconsistent state, repeated runs producing divergent outcomes.

- R-007: Deployment validations without environment isolation guarantees
  - Evidence/Quote: "/deploy produces deployment_manifest.yaml; ... health ... monitoring artifacts" (L41), "Deployment gate passes; health checks succeed" (L42)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Deployment and Observability (L39–L42)
  - Downstream Impact: Tests may run against shared or incorrect environment; noisy signals and false alarms.

- R-008: Memory bridge depends on environment configuration
  - Evidence/Quote: "environment variable MEMORY_STORAGE_ROOT handling" (L49); "no divergence between systems" (L50)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Memory Bridge Integration (L47–L50)
  - Downstream Impact: Misrouted or inaccessible memory storage; integrity gaps between CLI and bridge.

- R-009: Concurrency and locking on shared filesystems
  - Evidence/Quote: "CRUD and lock handling" (L53); "No deadlocks; index updates are atomic" (L54)
  - Severity: High
  - Affected Steps: Sync and Promotion Flows (L51–L54)
  - Downstream Impact: Deadlocks, corruption, or partial writes under concurrent runs.

- R-010: Ambiguous performance SLA targets for durations
  - Evidence/Quote: "Pytest durations; coverage thresholds; ... top 10 durations under thresholds" (L66–L67)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Performance and Concurrency (L64–L67)
  - Downstream Impact: Inconsistent pass/fail criteria; test suite brittleness.

- R-011: Security gates may block without exception policy
  - Evidence/Quote: "/security_scan, /threat_model, /compliance_check" (L70); "No high/critical issues; violations block pipelines" (L71)
  - Severity: High
  - Affected Steps: Security Posture Tests (L68–L71)
  - Downstream Impact: Hard blocks from legacy/transient issues; unclear triage/escalation path.

- R-012: Planner-first mode may conflict with non-interactive pipelines
  - Evidence/Quote: "/planner_mode on|off, confirmation requirements, restricted actions without confirmation" (L74–L75)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Planner-first Mode and Toggles (L72–L75), Core/Extended pipelines (L31–L38)
  - Downstream Impact: Stalled automation if confirmations are required in CI.

- R-013: Disaster recovery rehearsal side effects
  - Evidence/Quote: "Simulated rollback succeeds; all artifacts restored" (L79)
  - Severity: Medium
  - Affected Steps: Disaster Recovery and Rollback Rehearsal (L76–L79)
  - Downstream Impact: Altered artifacts or state during rehearsal; restoration gaps if not truly idempotent.

- R-014: Documentation/analysis workflows may interfere with pipeline state
  - Evidence/Quote: "/docs, /update_docs, /validate_docs; /review, /analyze, /benchmark interactions" (L45–L46)
  - Severity: Low
  - Affected Steps: Documentation and Analyst Collaboration (L43–L46)
  - Downstream Impact: Race conditions when artifacts are regenerated during active pipelines.

## 3) Potential Blind Spots
- B-001: Absence of RBAC/permissions model for command execution (no mention L1–L86)
- B-002: Secrets management and sensitive artifact handling (no mention L1–L86)
- B-003: Toolchain/version pinning for validators and renderers (e.g., Mermaid, pytest, Bandit) (no mention L1–L86)

- B-005: Idempotency guarantees for repeated runs across all phases (implied but not specified; L31–L38, L76–L79)
- B-006: Data volume/size stress testing beyond schema size bounds (L11–L13 mentions bounds, but not large-scale stress)
- B-007: Staging vs production environment segregation for deployment checks (L39–L42 do not specify target env)
- B-008: Audit logging integrity and tamper evidence (no explicit checks beyond "audit logs" format; L23–L25)
- B-009: Exception/waiver handling for security gate failures (policy absent; L68–L71)
- B-010: Time synchronization and ordering guarantees for handoff logs (no mention L34)

## 4) Assumptions (explicit/implicit) & their fragility
- A-001: All listed commands exist and are routable (L4) — Fragile if any are unimplemented/renamed.
- A-002: Baseline routing references exist and are current (L5) — Fragile to drift.
- A-003: Role toggles and dependency graph are fully encoded (L8) — Fragile if partial.
- A-004: Artifact schemas and validators are complete and performant (L10–L13) — Fragile to edge cases.
- A-005: Hydration/routing utilities are deterministic under all inputs (L14–L21) — Fragile to path/OS variance.
- A-006: CI has required tools (pytest, Mermaid, YAML linters, Bandit/Safety) (L23–L25, L68–L71) — Fragile to environment.
- A-007: Memory storage environment variable is set and accessible (L49) — Fragile to env config.
- A-008: File locks and atomicity are reliable on the target filesystem (L53–L54) — Fragile on NFS/SMB.
- A-009: Coverage ≥ 80% is achievable and stable (L67) — Fragile in new/legacy codebases.
- A-010: Planner-first confirmations can be automated or bypassed in CI (L74–L75) — Fragile if interactive-only.

## 5) Ambiguities & Measurement Gaps
- M-001: "aligns with baseline" (L5) — Baseline source and update cadence unspecified.
- M-002: "perf thresholds met (<2ms/<5ms)" (L13) — Hardware/env and sampling methodology unspecified.
- M-003: "handoff_log contains expected transitions" (L34) — Expected states not enumerated.
- M-004: "gates pass with required inputs" (L38) — Required inputs not fully enumerated.
- M-005: "health checks succeed" (L42) — Success criteria and SLIs/SLOs unspecified.
- M-006: "top 10 durations under thresholds" (L67) — Threshold values not defined here; only alluded to in L86.
- M-007: "no race conditions or file lock contention" (L67) — Detection methodology unspecified.
- M-008: "restorable" snapshots (L54) — Recovery point objective (RPO) / recovery time objective (RTO) unspecified.

## 6) Consistency Issues (within plan & across refs)
- C-001: Optional roles default disabled (L8) vs. Core sequential workflow expecting end-to-end success (L31–L34) — Potentially conflicting initial conditions.
- C-002: Planner-first confirmations (L74–L75) vs. non-interactive CI workflows (L31–L38) — Conflicting automation expectations.
- C-003: Performance thresholds referenced in L86 vs. unspecified numeric thresholds for durations in L67 — Cross-reference reliance without explicit values here.

## 7) Compliance/Feasibility/Timeline/Scope findings
- Compliance: Security checks present (L68–L71), but exception/waiver governance absent (High risk of pipeline deadlock).
- Feasibility: Strict perf thresholds (L13) and coverage ≥ 80% (L67) may be challenging across environments (Medium).
- Timeline: No timelines or resource allocations provided (Medium; execution planning risk).
- Scope: Very broad surface (L4, L80–L86) including new framework creation and promotion flows — risk of scope creep (Medium).
