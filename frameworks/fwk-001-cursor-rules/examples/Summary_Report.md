### 1) Context Summary (type/intent detected)
- Type: Operational / Execution plan
- Intent: Integrate an AI-driven Memory Bridge (JSON + SQLite), perform rules-based selection and integration, containerize services with Docker Compose, enable cross-machine worker with Redis backbone, support hybrid inference with cloud fallback, target 50+ concurrent tasks, implement observability checks, and define a rollback and PR workflow.
- Scope includes: selection dry-run and apply, memory bridge prototype, Docker Compose stack, cross-machine instructions, hybrid inference policy, concurrency tests, observability, rollback, and git hygiene.

### 2) Critical Risks
- R-001 — Progressive integration applied with protections disabled
  - Evidence/Quote: "--apply --progressive off" (L15-L19)
  - Affected Steps: 5, 6, 15
  - Severity: High
  - Downstream Impact: Unprotected routing/config changes; higher likelihood of unintended rule activation and drift without guardrails.

- R-002 — Redis exposed cross-machine without authentication/TLS
  - Evidence/Quote: "ensure 6379/tcp open" and remote `REDIS_URL` usage (L136-L139)
  - Affected Steps: 12
  - Severity: High
  - Downstream Impact: Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, command injection, lateral movement; non-compliant with basic security standards.

- R-003 — SQLite backing store under high concurrency (50+ tasks)
  - Evidence/Quote: Memory bridge uses sqlite3 with per-call connections and no WAL or retry (L35-L66); concurrency target noted (L145-L151)
  - Affected Steps: 7, 8, 14
  - Severity: High
  - Downstream Impact: "database is locked" errors, write contention, data loss/corruption risk, stalled workers.

- R-004 — Orchestrator healthcheck references localhost:8080 with no declared port
  - Evidence/Quote: Healthcheck command connects to ('localhost', 8080) (L115-L118); no ports mapping specified for orchestrator
  - Affected Steps: 10, 11
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Perpetual unhealthy status or false negatives; churn due to restarts; delayed readiness.

- R-005 — GPU reservation via compose `deploy.resources` likely ineffective
  - Evidence/Quote: `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` under Compose v3 (L126-L131)
  - Affected Steps: 10, 11
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: GPU not utilized as intended; degraded performance; configuration silently ignored on non-Swarm setups.

- R-006 — Cloud fallback policy undefined and unbounded
  - Evidence/Quote: `quality = score(output)` with fallback if < 0.85; external call to `call_cloud_llm` (L141-L145)
  - Affected Steps: 13
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Uncontrolled cost/egress; privacy/PII exposure; undefined scoring method leads to nondeterministic routing.

- R-007 — Log and value truncation silently discards data
  - Evidence/Quote: `json.dumps(payload)[:200000]` and `json.dumps(value)[:200000]` (L47, L52)
  - Affected Steps: 7, 8, 9
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Incomplete audit trail; data loss in memory values; challenges in incident reconstruction and compliance.

- R-008 — Limited rollback scope
  - Evidence/Quote: Only `routing_override.yaml` is restored (L155-L157)
  - Affected Steps: 16
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Partial revert may leave selection/integration side-effects and DB/log changes intact; residual drift.

- R-009 — Cross-machine worker build/runtime ambiguity
  - Evidence/Quote: Worker brought up on PC2 using same compose file (L136-L140) while service uses `build: .` (L121-L123)
  - Affected Steps: 10, 12
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Image/build context mismatch on remote host; runtime drift; environment-specific failures.

- R-010 — Observability checks lack gating and clear acceptance criteria
  - Evidence/Quote: Expect WARN due to Progressive=OFF; "ensure drift=0" without measurement method (L20-L33, L151-L154)
  - Affected Steps: 6, 15
  - Severity: Low–Medium
  - Downstream Impact: False sense of safety; undetected regressions; inconsistent drift interpretation.

- R-011 — Insufficient input validation and error handling in memory bridge CLI
  - Evidence/Quote: CLI commands call `json.loads` without try/except; DB ops lack retries (L67-L83)
  - Affected Steps: 7, 8, 9
  - Severity: Low–Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Uncaught exceptions, partial writes, poor robustness under malformed inputs.

- R-012 — PR workflow preserves Progressive=OFF
  - Evidence/Quote: "keep Progressive=OFF" for PR (L163) with earlier `--apply --progressive off` (L15-L19)
  - Affected Steps: 5, 17
  - Severity: Medium
  - Downstream Impact: Risk of merging weakened safeguards; normalization of disabled protections.

### 3) Potential Blind Spots
- B-001 — Capacity and queueing model for 50+ concurrency not described; throughput/latency targets absent (L145-L151).
- B-002 — Data retention, compaction, and backup strategy for SQLite not specified; disk growth and recovery posture unclear (L35-L66).
- B-003 — Secrets management for cloud LLM and Redis not described; key rotation/auditing missing (L123-L126, L136-L139, L141-L145).
- B-004 — Network policies/firewall scope and segmentation not defined for cross-machine traffic (L136-L139).
- B-005 — Disaster recovery testing (restore, failover) not covered beyond a single file rollback (L155-L157).
- B-006 — Observability SLOs (availability, latency, error budget) and alert thresholds not defined (L20-L33, L151-L154).

### 4) Assumptions (explicit/implicit) & fragility
- A-001 — `redis-cli` available in `redis:7-alpine` for health checks (L97-L103) — fragile if image changes.
- A-002 — Orchestrator listens on 8080 inside container (L115-L118) — fragile without explicit port configuration.
- A-003 — PC2 has compatible GPU drivers/runtime for containerized workload (L126-L131) — fragile across hosts.
- A-004 — `score(output)` is reliable and correlated with quality (L141-L144) — fragile without calibration.
- A-005 — SQLite will suffice for 50+ concurrent operations (L145-L151) — fragile under write-heavy loads.

### 5) Ambiguities & Measurement Gaps
- M-001 — "drift=0" criteria and measurement method are unspecified (L20-L33).
- M-002 — "<2m recovery" lacks a defined failure taxonomy and measurement protocol (L9-L11, L145-L151).
- M-003 — Quality threshold 0.85 lacks validation dataset, confidence intervals, or monitoring (L141-L145).
- M-004 — "100% audit trail" claim conflicts with payload truncation (L47, L52).

### 6) Consistency Issues
- C-001 — Compose `deploy.resources` GPU section is Swarm-oriented, but the plan uses `docker compose` (non-Swarm) (L121-L131).
- C-002 — Orchestrator healthcheck assumes an internal port (8080) that is not declared; readiness vs liveness conflation (L115-L118).
- C-003 — Scaling guidance ("scale worker=4") not aligned with 50+ concurrency goal; no linkage to queue depth (L146-L147).

### 7) Compliance / Feasibility / Timeline / Scope Findings
- Compliance: Unsecured Redis over LAN/WAN (L136-L139) and cloud egress without stated data controls (L141-L145) raise security/privacy concerns.
- Feasibility: SQLite under 50+ concurrent tasks (L145-L151) is questionable without WAL/tuning; GPU reservation via Compose (L126-L131) may not be honored.
- Timeline: No explicit time or sequencing buffers; cross-machine setup may stall on network/firewall prerequisites (L136-L139).
- Scope: Rollback limited to one file (L155-L157); does not cover DB/log/state reversions.
