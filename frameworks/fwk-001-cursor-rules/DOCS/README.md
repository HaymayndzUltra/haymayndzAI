fwk-001-cursor-rules — Framework Documentation

Purpose
- Centralized, versioned docs for roles, routing, pipeline, gates, artifacts, status, and change process.

Contents
- OVERVIEW.md — high-level goals, concepts, quick-start
- ROLES_MATRIX.md — enabled roles, triggers, dependencies, routing
- PIPELINE_AND_GATES.md — orchestration summary and gate policies
- ARTIFACTS.md — Action_Plan, Summary_Report, Validation_Report, Final_Implementation_Plan
- STATUS.md — current policy/mode, open decisions, checklist
- CHANGELOG.md — human-readable change log
- PROCESS.md — rules for documenting future changes

Source of truth
- Canonical policies live under system-prompt/*. Keep DOCS in sync with those files.

How to use
- Read OVERVIEW first. Before changing any role/gate, read PROCESS. After any change, update STATUS and CHANGELOG.
