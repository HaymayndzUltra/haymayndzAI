## Labnotes Explainer (Human-Readable)

Purpose: A concise guide to understand what was done in `Labnotes.md`, why it was done, how it was verified, and how to cleanly organize next updates.

### Project Scope (from Labnotes)
- Memory System Hardening: make IO safe, unify state, normalize timezones, log executions, improve recall portability, and adopt append-only archives.

### Phases — What changed and why
- Phase 1 — Atomic IO + Locking: Prevent partial/corrupted writes with atomic temp-file swaps and advisory locks; enables safe concurrent access.
- Phase 3 — Cursor State Unification: Standardize where `cursor_state.json` and session files live to remove path drift and tooling ambiguity.
- Phase 4 — PH Timezone Normalization (ZoneInfo): Ensure timestamps are consistent and unambiguous; simplify audits and comparisons.
- Phase 5 — Execution Run Logging: Persist per-run execution metadata for reproducibility, debugging, and post-hoc analysis.
- Phase 6 — memory_cli Recall Fallback + Portability: Improve recall behavior across environments; add sane fallbacks when preferred stores are absent.
- Phase 7 — Archival Policy (JSONL Append-only): Enforce append-only knowledge logs for immutability and simpler diffs.
- Documentation: Align docs with the above changes and add navigation aids.

### Tests & Results — What verifies each phase
- T1 — Concurrency Smoke Test (P1): Confirms atomic writes and lock-handling under parallel access.
- T2 — Single-writer `current-session.md` (P2/3): Verifies only one source writes; others queue or read-only.
- T3 — Cursor State Path Unification (P3): Ensures all components read the same canonical state file.
- T4 — Timezone Normalization (P4): Asserts timestamps are normalized and parsable.
- T5 — Exec Run Logging (P5): Confirms per-run artifacts and indices are written.
- T6 — Recall Fallback (P6): Verifies recall still works when a preferred backend is missing.
- T7 — Archival JSONL (P7): Ensures entries are append-only and queryable.

### File Inventory — How to read each change entry
Every `CREATE`/`MODIFY` entry follows the same sections:
- Summary: 1–3 sentences explaining what changed.
- Reason / Motivation: Why the change was necessary.
- Details of Change: Key technical steps, file/function touch-points.
- Tests Executed & Results / Observations: What proved it works.
- Acceptance / Verification: Pass criteria and status.
- Risks / Impact & Rollback / Recovery: Known risks and how to revert.
- Follow-ups / Next Steps & Traceability: What remains and where it links in plans.

Tip: Open `DOCS/labnotes_index/TOC.md` to jump to a specific entry via line numbers (Lxxx) in `Labnotes.md`.

### How to clean this up (organize “pano aayusin”) 
1) Normalize entries
   - Ensure all entries have complete sections; replace placeholders (e.g., “# add commands here”).
   - Standardize timestamps/timezones and `CREATE`/`MODIFY` headers.

2) Strengthen verification
   - Move pass/fail evidence into “Acceptance / Verification” with links to test artifacts.
   - Prefer concrete metrics (e.g., latency, error rate, coverage).

3) Tighten traceability
   - In “Traceability”, link to: Action_Plan sections, Summary_Report risks, Validation_Report outcomes, and Final_Implementation_Plan tasks.
   - Tag entries with phase IDs (P1..P7) and test IDs (T1..T7) for quick cross-reference.

4) Promote finished work
   - For entries with PASS and low risk, migrate the final steps into `Final_Implementation_Plan.md` and mark Labnotes entry as “Accepted”.

5) Archive policy
   - Keep raw evidence in append-only JSONL.
   - Summarize outcomes in Labnotes, and link to the immutable record.

### Quick Navigation Aids
- Summary/Counts: `DOCS/labnotes_index/SUMMARY.md`
- Structure (TOC): `DOCS/labnotes_index/TOC.md`
- Decisions: `DOCS/labnotes_index/DECISIONS.md`
- Actions: `DOCS/labnotes_index/ACTIONS.md`
- Changes/Gates: `DOCS/labnotes_index/CHANGES.md`
