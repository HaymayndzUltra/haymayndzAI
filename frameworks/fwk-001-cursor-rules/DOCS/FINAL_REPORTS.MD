# ðŸ“‹ FORENSIC ANALYSIS REPORT: ROLE-BASED AI SYSTEM WORKFLOW
**Analysis Date:** 2025-01-28
**System Location:** `/workspace/.cursor/rules/`
**Report Author:** Forensic Analyst
**Evidence Method:** File Path + Line Range Only

---

## A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The `.cursor/rules/` directory contains 42 files total: 40 MDC rule files implementing a sophisticated AI development environment plus 1 README.md and 1 PNG diagram. Evidence shows 17 AI role files (*_ai.mdc), 5 orchestration/routing rules, 5 guidance rules, 13 domain/standards rules. The system uses a pipeline-based workflow orchestrated by `execution_orchestrator.mdc` (323 lines) with role activation managed by `rules_master_toggle.mdc` (210 lines). Active memory-bank system exists with queue management in `/workspace/memory-bank/queue-system/` containing 8 JSON task files.

## D. GLOBS & COVERAGE

**Universal Coverage Rules (Evidence: grep output)**
- 28 rules use glob: ["**/*"] - applies to all files
- 6 rules use empty glob: [] - no automatic application
- 6 rules use specific file patterns:
  - Python rules: ["**/*.py", "pyproject.toml", "requirements.txt"]
  - Solidity rule: ["**/*.sol", "hardhat.config.*", "foundry.toml"]
  - Terraform rule: ["**/*.tf", "**/*.tfvars"]
  - JavaScript/TypeScript rule: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"]

**Sample Matched Files for ["**/*"] glob:**
1. /workspace/.cursor/rules/*.mdc (42 files found via ls command)
2. /workspace/memory-bank/queue-system/*.json (8 files found)
3. /workspace/src/repo/*.py (5 files found)
4. /workspace/tools/*.py (3 files verified)
5. /workspace/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/DOCS/*.md (16 files found)

**Empty Glob Rules (Evidence: grep output)**
- project-guidance.mdc (line 3)
- test-rules-management.mdc (line 3)
- technology-stacks.mdc (line 4)
- ai-assistant-guidance.mdc (line 3)
- planning_ai.mdc (line 3)

**MISSING - Referenced But Not Found:**

| Referenced Path | Status | Evidence Source |

| plan_next.py | MISSING | framework_memory_bridge.mdc:49 |

## F. RISKS & GAPS

**1. Missing Python Implementation Files (Evidence: grep searches returned no matches)**
- Referenced files in framework_memory_bridge.mdc:45-56 don't exist
- Task Command Center (583 lines) referenced but not found (framework_memory_bridge.mdc:98)
- Workflow intelligence (1950 lines) referenced but not found (framework_memory_bridge.mdc:99)

**2. Overlapping Command Routes (Evidence: rules_master_toggle.mdc:161 vs line 67)**
- `/review` command mapped to both analyst_ai (line 161) and qa_ai (line 48)
- Potential conflict without clear precedence rule

**3. Incomplete Gate Implementation (Evidence: execution_orchestrator.mdc:133-160)**
- Audit gate enabled but auditor_ai implementation partial
- Verification gate enabled but validation reports missing
- Synthesis gate enabled but Final_Implementation_Plan generation incomplete

**4. Glob Coverage Overlap (Evidence: grep output analyzed)**
- 28 rules all apply to every file via ["**/*"]
- No specificity in most role targeting
- Potential performance impact from multiple rule evaluations

**5. Multiple Always-Active Rules (Evidence: 7 rules with alwaysApply:true)**
- Could cause rule conflicts or performance issues
- No clear precedence order defined

## G. RECOMMENDATIONS (EVIDENCE-BASED ONLY)

1. **Implement Missing Python Files**
   - Create 7 missing files referenced in framework_memory_bridge.mdc:45-99
   - Evidence: grep searches show files don't exist

2. **Resolve Command Routing Conflicts**
   - Clarify `/review` command precedence between analyst_ai and qa_ai
   - Evidence: rules_master_toggle.mdc:48,67,161 conflicts

3. **Add Glob Specificity**
   - 28 rules use ["**/*"] - consider file-type specific patterns
   - Evidence: Only 6 rules use specific patterns currently

4. **Complete Gate Implementation**
   - Implement missing audit/validation/synthesis logic
   - Evidence: execution_orchestrator.mdc:133-160 gates defined but tools missing

5. **Optimize Always-Active Rules**
   - Review 7 always-active rules for necessity
   - Evidence: Multiple rules with alwaysApply:true could impact performance
