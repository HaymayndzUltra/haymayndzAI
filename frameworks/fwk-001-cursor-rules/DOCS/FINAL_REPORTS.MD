# ðŸ“‹ FORENSIC ANALYSIS REPORT: ROLE-BASED AI SYSTEM WORKFLOW
**Analysis Date:** 2025-01-28
**System Location:** `/workspace/.cursor/rules/`
**Report Author:** Forensic Analyst
**Evidence Method:** File Path + Line Range Only

---

## A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The `.cursor/rules/` directory contains 42 rule files implementing a sophisticated AI development environment. Evidence shows 17 AI role files (*_ai.mdc), 4 orchestration/routing rules, 5 guidance rules, and 16 domain/standards rules. The system uses a pipeline-based workflow orchestrated by `execution_orchestrator.mdc` (323 lines) with role activation managed by `rules_master_toggle.mdc` (210 lines). Active memory-bank system exists with queue management in `/workspace/memory-bank/queue-system/` containing task files.

## D. GLOBS & COVERAGE

**Universal Coverage Rules (Evidence: Multiple files with glob ["**/*"])**
- All AI role files use glob: ["**/*"]
- All orchestration rules use glob: ["**/*"]
- Guidance rules use glob: ["**/*"]

**Sample Matched Files for ["**/*"] glob:**
1. /workspace/.cursor/rules/*.mdc (42 files found via ls command)
2. /workspace/memory-bank/queue-system/*.json (8 files found)
3. /workspace/src/repo/*.py (5 files found)
4. /workspace/tools/*.py (3 files verified)
5. /workspace/frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/DOCS/*.md (16 files found)

**Empty Glob Rules (Evidence: Direct file inspection)**
- project-guidance.mdc (line 3: globs: [])
- test-rules-management.mdc (line 3: globs: [])

## E. CROSS-REFERENCE (FOUND vs MISSING)

**FOUND - Verified Existing Files:**

| Referenced Path | Status | Evidence |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| memory-bank/ | FOUND | Directory exists with subdirs |
| memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json | FOUND | File exists (8.4KB, 63 lines) |
| memory-bank/cursor_state.json | FOUND | File exists (291B, 10 lines) |
| memory-bank/task_state.json | FOUND | File exists (328B, 8 lines) |
| memory-bank/current-session.md | FOUND | File exists (338B, 11 lines) |
| memory-bank/plan/ | FOUND | Directory exists |

**MISSING - Referenced But Not Found:**

| Referenced Path | Status | Evidence Source |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| workflow_memory_intelligence_fixed.py | MISSING | framework_memory_bridge.mdc:32,51 |
| plan_next.py | MISSING | framework_memory_bridge.mdc:49 |
| memory_cli.py | MISSING | framework_memory_bridge.mdc:53-55 |
| task_command_center.py | MISSING | framework_memory_bridge.mdc:98 |
| cursor_memory_bridge.py | MISSING | memory_enhancement_auditor.mdc:18 |

## F. RISKS & GAPS

**1. Missing Python Implementation Files (Evidence: grep searches returned no matches)**
- Referenced files in framework_memory_bridge.mdc:45-56 don't exist
- Task Command Center (583 lines) referenced but not found
- Workflow intelligence (1950 lines) referenced but not found

**2. Overlapping Command Routes (Evidence: rules_master_toggle.mdc:161 vs analyst_ai routing)**
- `/review` command mapped to both analyst_ai and qa_ai
- Potential conflict without clear precedence rule

**3. Incomplete Gate Implementation (Evidence: execution_orchestrator.mdc:133-160)**
- Audit gate enabled but auditor_ai implementation partial (per FINAL_REPORTS.MD:331-609)
- Verification gate enabled but validation reports missing

**4. Glob Coverage Overlap (Evidence: All role files use ["**/*"])**
- 35+ rules all apply to every file
- No specificity in file targeting
- Potential performance impact

## G. RECOMMENDATIONS (EVIDENCE-BASED ONLY)

1. **Implement Missing Python Files**
   - Create files referenced in framework_memory_bridge.mdc:45-56
   - Evidence: grep searches show files don't exist

2. **Resolve Command Routing Conflicts**
   - Clarify `/review` command precedence
   - Evidence: rules_master_toggle.mdc:161 conflict

3. **Add Glob Specificity**
   - Consider file-type specific globs for role files
   - Evidence: All 17 AI roles use ["**/*"] universally

4. **Complete Gate Implementation**
   - Implement missing audit/validation logic
   - Evidence: execution_orchestrator.mdc gates defined but tools missing
