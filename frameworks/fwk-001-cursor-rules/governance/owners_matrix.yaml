# Framework Governance - Owners Matrix (RACI)
# T-12 Implementation: Governance fields, RACI, estimates, acceptance

## Overview
Comprehensive RACI matrix defining roles and responsibilities for all framework components, tasks, and operational activities. Ensures clear ownership, accountability, and governance across the entire framework.

## RACI Definitions
- **R (Responsible)**: Person/team who does the work
- **A (Accountable)**: Person/team who is ultimately accountable
- **C (Consulted)**: Person/team who provides input/feedback
- **I (Informed)**: Person/team who is kept informed of progress
