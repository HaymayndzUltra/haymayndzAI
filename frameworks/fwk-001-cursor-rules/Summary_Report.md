# Summary Report — Audit of Action Plan

## Context Summary
- Scope: Memory system hardening (atomic IO, locks, single-writer markdown, cursor state SoT, PH timezone, execution logging, recall fallback, archival).
- Inputs reviewed: `Action_Plan.md`, repository code under memory modules.

## Critical Risks (R-###)
- R-001 (HIGH): Competing writers for `current-session.md` may cause drift or corruption.
  - Evidence:
    - `auto_sync_manager.py` writes markdown directly (lines 221–223)
    - `cursor_memory_bridge.py` also writes markdown (lines 61–67)
- R-002 (HIGH): Non-atomic writes to queue SoT (`tasks_active.json`) risk truncation/corruption under concurrency.
  - Evidence:
    - `todo_manager.py` `_save` uses direct `write_text` (lines 85–101)
- R-003 (HIGH): Cursor state split-brain (root vs memory-bank) causes inconsistency across tools.
  - Evidence:
    - `cursor_session_manager.py` default path is root `cursor_state.json` (line 19)
    - `auto_sync_manager.py` uses `memory-bank/cursor_state.json` (lines 41–46)
- R-004 (MEDIUM): Timezone handling inconsistent (mix of naive `utcnow()` and aware ISO) leading to misordering and incorrect retention.
  - Evidence:
    - `todo_manager.py` uses `datetime.utcnow()` with `fromisoformat` (lines 64–75)
    - Multiple modules stamp with `utcnow().isoformat()` (e.g., `task_interruption_manager.py` lines 42–47)
- R-005 (MEDIUM): Execution logging lacks structured outputs and redaction; difficult for diagnostics.
  - Evidence:
    - `todo_manager.py` `exec_substep` prints only; no `.out/.err/.json` persisted (lines 637–651)
- R-006 (LOW): `memory_cli recall` forces embeddings/model even when fallback search is intended.
  - Evidence:
    - Model required in `load_model` and used in `cmd_recall` regardless of index presence (lines 44–48, 141–147 in `tools/memory/memory_cli.py`)
- R-007 (LOW): Hardcoded absolute storage paths reduce portability.
  - Evidence:
    - `tools/memory/pro_config.yaml` storage root set to an absolute user path (lines 15–21)
- R-008 (LOW): Logging dependency `common.utils.log_setup` may be absent → import error.
  - Evidence:
    - `auto_sync_manager.py` and `workflow_memory_intelligence_fixed.py` import `configure_logging` from `common.utils.log_setup`

## Blind Spots
- Lack of quantitative acceptance tests for atomicity/locking and crash durability.
- No explicit redaction policy for run logs.
- No retention/rotation policy for task archives/logs.

## Assumptions
- Linux with `flock(2)` available; local filesystem for SoT files.
- Python ≥ 3.10; no other external writers to SoT.

## Ambiguities
- Ownership map: exact boundary between `AutoSyncManager` and `cursor_memory_bridge` for markdown generation during transitions.

## Consistency Issues
- Task state files naming/location mismatch:
  - `task-state.json` (root) vs `memory-bank/task_state.json` (AutoSync).
  - `task_interruption_state.json` (root) vs `memory-bank/task_interruption_state.json` (AutoSync).

## Compliance / Feasibility / Timeline / Scope
- Feasible in phased rollout (2–3 weeks) with feature flags for single-writer enforcement.
- Requires adding tests (latency, durability) and documentation updates.

## Traceability (selected)
- `auto_sync_manager.py` 221–223; 41–46
- `cursor_memory_bridge.py` 61–67
- `cursor_session_manager.py` 19
- `todo_manager.py` 64–75; 85–101; 637–651
- `task_interruption_manager.py` 42–47
- `tools/memory/memory_cli.py` 44–48; 141–147
- `tools/memory/pro_config.yaml` 15–21

## Verdict
- Proceed with Phases 1–3 as P0 (Atomic IO+locks; single-writer enforcement; cursor state unification), then Phases 4–7.
- Block execution that writes SoT until Phase 1 is implemented or guarded by locks/atomic writes.
