# Hydration Rules â€” Deterministic Input Selection

## Precedence
- approved > review > draft
- Tie-breakers: higher updatedAt, then lexical id/path

## Determinism
- Repeated runs over identical inputs must yield identical selections.

## Validation
- Provide test vectors in `hydration_tests.yaml` and CI check for stability across runs.
