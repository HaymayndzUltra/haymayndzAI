# Multi-Writer Hardening - Lease Design

## Overview
Enhanced concurrency control for the artifacts index to handle multiple concurrent writers safely while maintaining data integrity and performance.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Concurrency Mechanisms
- **File-based locking**: Uses `fcntl.flock()` for single-writer exclusion
- **Journaling**: Write-ahead logging for crash recovery
- **Atomic replacement**: `os.replace()` for safe file updates

### Limitations Identified
- **Single-writer only**: No support for concurrent writers
- **Blocking operations**: Writers must wait for lock release
- **No lease management**: No timeout or deadlock detection
- **Limited scalability**: Bottleneck for high-throughput scenarios

## Enhanced Lease Design

### 1. Distributed Lease System

#### Lease Structure
```json
{
  "lease_id": "uuid-v4",
  "writer_id": "unique_writer_identifier",
  "resource": "artifacts_index.json",
  "acquired_at": "2025-08-24T05:20:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2025-08-24T05:25:00Z",
  "renewal_count": 0,
  "max_renewals": 10,
  "status": "active|expired|released"
}
```

#### Lease Storage
- **Primary**: `artifacts_index.leases` (JSON file)
- **Backup**: `artifacts_index.leases.backup`
- **Journal**: `artifacts_index.leases.journal`

### 2. Multi-Writer Coordination

#### Writer Registration
1. **Request lease**: Writer requests exclusive access
2. **Lease acquisition**: System grants lease with timeout
3. **Write operation**: Writer performs atomic update
4. **Lease release**: Writer releases lease after completion

#### Concurrent Write Handling
```python
class MultiWriterIndex:
    def acquire_lease(self, writer_id: str, timeout_seconds: int = 300) -> Lease:
        """Acquire exclusive lease for writing."""
        
    def release_lease(self, lease_id: str) -> bool:
        """Release acquired lease."""
        
    def write_with_lease(self, lease_id: str, data: Dict) -> bool:
        """Write data using valid lease."""
        
    def detect_conflicts(self) -> List[Conflict]:
        """Detect and report write conflicts."""
```

### 3. Conflict Detection and Resolution

#### Conflict Types
1. **Write-Write conflicts**: Multiple writers modifying same artifacts
2. **Lease expiration**: Writer holding expired lease
3. **Deadlock detection**: Circular lease dependencies
4. **Stale data**: Writer using outdated index version

#### Resolution Strategies
- **Optimistic locking**: Version-based conflict detection
- **Conflict-free data types**: CRDT-like structures where possible
- **Merge strategies**: Automatic conflict resolution for compatible changes
- **Manual resolution**: User intervention for complex conflicts

### 4. Performance Optimizations

#### Lease Pooling
- **Short-term leases**: 30 seconds for quick updates
- **Long-term leases**: 5 minutes for batch operations
- **Lease renewal**: Automatic extension for active operations

#### Write Batching
- **Batch operations**: Multiple updates in single lease
- **Pipeline processing**: Queue-based write processing
- **Async operations**: Non-blocking write operations

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Lease Manager
```python
class LeaseManager:
    def __init__(self, lease_file: str, max_leases: int = 10):
        self.lease_file = lease_file
        self.max_leases = max_leases
        self.active_leases = {}
        
    def acquire_lease(self, writer_id: str, duration: int = 300) -> Optional[Lease]:
        """Acquire lease with timeout."""
        
    def release_lease(self, lease_id: str) -> bool:
        """Release lease and cleanup."""
        
    def validate_lease(self, lease_id: str) -> bool:
        """Check if lease is still valid."""
        
    def cleanup_expired_leases(self) -> int:
        """Remove expired leases and return count."""
```

#### 2. Conflict Detector
```python
class ConflictDetector:
    def __init__(self, index_path: str):
        self.index_path = index_path
        
    def detect_write_conflicts(self, new_data: Dict, existing_data: Dict) -> List[Conflict]:
        """Detect conflicts between new and existing data."""
        
    def resolve_conflicts(self, conflicts: List[Conflict]) -> Dict:
        """Resolve detected conflicts automatically."""
        
    def generate_conflict_report(self, conflicts: List[Conflict]) -> str:
        """Generate human-readable conflict report."""
```

#### 3. Enhanced Index Writer
```python
class EnhancedIndexWriter:
    def __init__(self, index_path: str, lease_manager: LeaseManager):
        self.index_path = index_path
        self.lease_manager = lease_manager
        self.conflict_detector = ConflictDetector(index_path)
        
    def write_with_lease(self, lease_id: str, data: Dict) -> WriteResult:
        """Write data using valid lease with conflict detection."""
        
    def batch_write(self, lease_id: str, operations: List[Dict]) -> BatchWriteResult:
        """Execute multiple write operations in single lease."""
        
    def read_with_consistency(self, consistency_level: str = "read_committed") -> Dict:
        """Read index with specified consistency level."""
```

### 4. Monitoring and Observability

#### Metrics Collection
- **Lease acquisition time**: Time to acquire lease
- **Write latency**: Time from lease acquisition to completion
- **Conflict rate**: Percentage of writes with conflicts
- **Lease utilization**: Active leases vs. capacity

#### Health Checks

- **Conflict health**: Unresolved conflicts
- **Performance health**: Write latency thresholds
- **Resource health**: Disk space and file permissions
