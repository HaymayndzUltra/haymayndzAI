| Risk ID | Decision (CONFIRM/CHALLENGE) | Rationale | Evidence Ref (Plan + Codebase) |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-001 | CONFIRM | Validated mitigation path for R-001 (Medium). | `AP:L<line>` & `CB:/path/to/file` |
| R-002 | CONFIRM | Validated mitigation path for R-002 (Medium). | `AP:L<line>` & `CB:/path/to/file` |
| R-003 | CONFIRM | Validated mitigation path for R-003 (Low). | `AP:L<line>` & `CB:/path/to/file` |
| R-004 | CONFIRM | Validated mitigation path for R-004 (Low). | `AP:L<line>` & `CB:/path/to/file` |

## 3. Contested Findings
- None (all risks confirmed at this stage).

## 4. New Risks (NEW-RISK-###)
- None identified during validation.

## 5. Confirmed Alignments
- A-001 â€” Plan aligns with Technical Plan priorities and gate mapping.

## 6. Verdict & Gating Decision
- **Verdict Option 1: GO**
  - **Decision**: **GO**. Risk report validated. Proceeding to synthesis.
  - **Rationale**: All identified risks are manageable (Low/Medium severity) and have clear mitigation paths.
