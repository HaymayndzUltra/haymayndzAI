   Description: 2024_master_bug_remediation (memory-bank/plan/organized.md)...
   Status: in_progress
   Created: 2025-08-17T19:15:00+08:00
   TODO Items (5):
      [✗] 0. PHASE 0: SETUP & PROTOCOL (READ FIRST)

**Explanations:** Read and follow the operating protocol. Execute phases sequentially without skipping. Use the provided commands to show status and mark completion. Each subsequent phase includes context, locations, and proposed fixes—review before execution.

**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817
python3 todo_manager.py done 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817 0
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: This phase contains the operating manual for this entire remediation plan. Completing it signifies your understanding of the process. Failure to follow the protocol can lead to incorrect state tracking.
      [✗] 1. PHASE 1: CRITICAL BUGS

**Explanations:** Address startup-crash and RCE-class issues first. Fix REP socket misuse and context/endpoint errors; remove unsafe `pickle` on untrusted inputs; correct misuse of `asyncio.create_task()` with sync `start()` functions to ensure core services boot reliably.

**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817
python3 todo_manager.py done 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817 1
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: The bugs in this phase are critical. They cause agents to crash on startup or introduce severe remote code execution vulnerabilities. The system is unstable and insecure until this phase is complete.
      [✗] 2. PHASE 2: HIGH-SEVERITY BUGS

**Explanations:** Remediate high-impact security and reliability issues. Fix invalid PUB socket pattern in error publisher; remove `eval()` in metrics logic; correct mixed sync/async shutdown calls; enforce fail-closed auth with restricted CORS in REST API.

**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817
python3 todo_manager.py done 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817 2
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: This phase addresses high-severity security vulnerabilities and architectural flaws. Completing it is essential for securing the system and ensuring its long-term stability.
      [✗] 3. PHASE 3: MEDIUM-SEVERITY BUGS

**Explanations:** Improve robustness and debuggability. Ensure GPU lease-sweeper thread is joined on shutdown; eliminate race on shared `voice_buffer`; replace bare `except: pass` in machine detection with precise exception handling and logging.

**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817
python3 todo_manager.py done 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817 3
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: These medium-severity bugs relate to race conditions and poor error handling. Fixing them will improve the system's robustness, thread safety, and debuggability.
      [✗] 4. PHASE 4: LOW-SEVERITY BUGS

**Explanations:** Final stabilization tasks. Reduce TTL reaper cadence to minimize transient VRAM over-allocation risk; add stop conditions to infinite background loops to ensure graceful shutdown.

**Concluding Step: Phase Completion Protocol**
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817
python3 todo_manager.py done 2024_master_bug_remediation_actionable_20250817 4
```

IMPORTANT NOTE: This final phase addresses low-severity bugs that improve resource management and ensure graceful shutdowns. Completing this phase finalizes the stabilization effort.

#ANALYSIS_RULES




1. 🗒️  2024_master_bug_remediation_analysis_20250817
   Description: Pre-execution analysis for 2024_master_bug_remediation (memory-bank/plan/organiz...
   Status: in_progress
   Created: 2025-08-17T19:15:00+08:00
   TODO Items (5):
      [✗] 0. PHASE 0: SETUP & PROTOCOL ANALYSIS (READ FIRST)

Purpose: Ensure there is one consistent understanding of the protocol, scope, and sequencing before starting.
Scope: semantic/architectural review (ownership, dependencies, category boundaries, logic parity). NOT in scope: runtime tests, syntax/health errors.

Checks:
• Protocol consistency: verify a single source of truth for remediation steps; no conflicts with other docs/tickets.
• Sequencing soundness: confirm explicit dependency order; no circularity between phases (0→4).
• Category definitions: criteria for Critical/High/Medium/Low are clear; no overlap or ambiguity.

• LOGIC PARITY CHECK:
  - Identify if multiple places define the remediation protocol or severity categories.
  - Compare Logic Identity (inputs, criteria/ordering, flow, outputs, side-effects) to mark SAME / CONFLICT / OVERLAP.

• DECISION GATE: Do not proceed if conflicting protocol versions or severity definitions exist.

──────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT NOTE: This phase is the semantic gate for the entire plan; there must be a single “truth” followed.
      [✗] 1. PHASE 1: CRITICAL BUGS — CATEGORY & OWNERSHIP ANALYSIS

Purpose: Validate that items marked CRITICAL (startup-crash/RCE-class) are correct and not overlapping with other phases.
Scope: classification boundaries, fix ownership, dependency direction. NOT in scope: executing fixes.

Checks:
• Category boundary: listed Critical items truly match Critical criteria; none should fall into High.
• Ownership: each issue (socket misuse, unsafe serialization, startup tasks) has one clear owner; avoid split ownership.
• Dependency: Critical fixes come first; no inversion where dependent fixes precede prerequisites.

• LOGIC PARITY CHECK:
  - Identify if multiple modules/teams enforce boot/security semantics.
  - Compare thresholds/policies/flows to detect SAME / CONFLICT / OVERLAP.

• DECISION GATE: Do not proceed if duplicate “critical enforcement logic” exists or if items are misclassified (e.g., belong in High).

──────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT NOTE: There must be a single canonical policy for boot safety and RCE prevention before remediation begins.
      [✗] 2. PHASE 2: HIGH-SEVERITY BUGS — POLICY & INTERFACE ANALYSIS

Purpose: Confirm that High-severity items are distinct from Critical and consistent in security/reliability policies.
Scope: policy boundaries (auth, CORS, eval removal), interface contracts (publish/subscribe patterns). NOT in scope: execution.

Checks:
• Policy boundary: authentication and CORS have a single authority; no competing layers.
• Interface contract: PUB/ERR patterns follow one canonical design; no alternate conflicting variants.
• Priority sanity: no High item is actually Critical (e.g., exploitable eval path); no Medium mistakenly listed here.

• LOGIC PARITY CHECK:
  - Identify if multiple security modules set auth/CORS or error-publishing rules.
  - Compare criteria and side-effects; mark SAME / CONFLICT / OVERLAP.

• DECISION GATE: Do not proceed if multiple security policies overlap or have opposite defaults.

──────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT NOTE: Security policy must come from a single source; adapters are fine, alternate competing policies are not.
      [✗] 3. PHASE 3: MEDIUM-SEVERITY BUGS — CONCURRENCY & ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS

Purpose: Validate concurrency lifecycle semantics and error-handling policies before fixes.
Scope: thread/async ownership, shared-state boundaries, error signaling contracts. NOT in scope: runtime race testing.

Checks:
• Lifecycle ownership: shutdown/start/join logic has one owner; no duplicate control points.
• Shared-state policy: no dual writers or ambiguous locks on shared buffers; guard strategy is explicit.
• Error contract: error handling is centralized and explicit; no bare “except: pass” swallowing semantics.

• LOGIC PARITY CHECK:
  - Detect duplicate lifecycle logic (e.g., multiple components handling shutdown joins).
  - Compare flows/guards/outputs to classify SAME / CONFLICT / OVERLAP.

• DECISION GATE: Do not proceed until lifecycle controls have a single owner and error policies are not duplicated.

──────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT NOTE: Concurrency semantics must be centralized and deterministic before applying patches.
      [✗] 4. PHASE 4: LOW-SEVERITY BUGS — RESOURCE & SHUTDOWN POLICY ANALYSIS

Purpose: Ensure resource-management and graceful-shutdown policies are unified with no conflicting defaults.
Scope: TTL/reaper cadence policy, loop stop-condition ownership. NOT in scope: running loops.

Checks:
• Single-source policy: TTL cadence and stop conditions come from one policy module; all else are consumers/adapters.
• Dependency awareness: no hidden coupling that causes contradictions (e.g., VRAM reclaim timing vs consumers).
• Documentation alignment: plan/config/code agree on cadence and shutdown semantics.

• LOGIC PARITY CHECK:
  - Review if multiple implementations define stop conditions or TTL cadence.
  - Compare criteria/flows/effects to classify SAME / CONFLICT / OVERLAP.

• DECISION GATE: Do not proceed if multiple cadence/stop policies overlap or diverge on defaults.

──────────────────────────────────
IMPORTANT NOTE: Resource/shutdown behavior must be governed by a single policy to avoid split semantics.
