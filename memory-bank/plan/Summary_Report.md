## 1. Context Summary (type/intent detected)
- **Plan Title**: AI ROLES & OUTPUTS - COPY PASTE LIST
- **Type**: Reference Documentation / Role Definition
- **Intent**: Provide a comprehensive catalog of 24 AI roles with their outputs and responsibilities for the HaymayndzAI Framework

## 2. Critical Risks (Conflicts with Codebase)
- **R-001 — Missing Technical Plan and Task Breakdown**
  - **Evidence/Quote**: ```1:1:memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md``` and ```1:1:memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml```
  - **Codebase Conflict**: The Action Plan references technical_plan.md and task_breakdown.yaml as context files, but both are empty (0 bytes). This creates a critical gap in the planning foundation.
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Affected Steps**: All phases that depend on technical planning and task breakdown
  - **Downstream Impact**: Inability to execute the development pipeline without proper technical specifications and task definitions

- **R-002 — Action Plan Mismatch with Product Backlog**
  - **Evidence/Quote**: ```1:129:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
  - **Codebase Conflict**: The Action Plan is a static role definition list, but the product_backlog.yaml contains 605 lines of detailed project requirements, phases, and acceptance criteria. The Action Plan doesn't reflect the actual project scope or implementation details.
  - **Severity**: High
  - **Affected Steps**: All project execution phases
  - **Downstream Impact**: Misalignment between documented roles and actual project requirements

- **R-003 — Incomplete Implementation Plan**
  - **Evidence/Quote**: ```1:37:memory-bank/plan/Final_Implementation_Plan.md```
  - **Codebase Conflict**: The Final Implementation Plan is a template with empty sections for objectives, assumptions, work breakdown, and execution phases. This provides no actionable guidance for project execution.
  - **Severity**: Medium
  - **Affected Steps**: Project execution and phase management
  - **Downstream Impact**: Lack of clear project direction and milestone tracking

## 3. Confirmed Alignments (Matches with Codebase)
- **A-001 — Execution Orchestrator Role Definition**
  - **Evidence/Quote**: ```62:62:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
  - **Codebase Alignment**: The Action Plan correctly identifies EXECUTION_ORCHESTRATOR as "Workflow state management, pipeline coordination" which matches the actual implementation in `.cursor/rules/execution_orchestrator.mdc` with pipeline coordination, gate rules, and workflow management.
  - **Rationale**: This role is properly implemented and documented in the codebase with the exact responsibilities described in the Action Plan.

- **A-002 — Auditor AI Role Implementation**
  - **Evidence/Quote**: ```42:42:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
  - **Codebase Alignment**: The Action Plan correctly identifies AUDITOR_AI as "Audit reports, improvement recommendations" which is fully implemented in `.cursor/rules/auditor_ai.mdc` with comprehensive audit capabilities and risk analysis functions.
  - **Rationale**: The auditor role is properly implemented with the exact functionality described, including the `/audit` command and risk assessment capabilities.

- **A-003 — AI Role Count Accuracy**
  - **Evidence/Quote**: ```119:119:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
  - **Codebase Alignment**: The Action Plan correctly identifies "TOTAL: 24 AI ROLES" which matches the actual count of role definitions found in the codebase through grep searches and file analysis.
  - **Rationale**: The role count is accurate and all mentioned roles have corresponding implementations or rule files in the system.

## 4. Potential Blind Spots
- **B-001 — Missing Phase Dependencies**
  - **Why it matters**: The Action Plan lists roles but doesn't define how they interact in phases or what gates exist between them. The execution_orchestrator.mdc shows a complex pipeline with gates, but the Action Plan doesn't reflect this workflow complexity.

- **B-002 — No Quality Gate Definitions**
  - **Why it matters**: While the execution_orchestrator defines QA gates and other checkpoints, the Action Plan doesn't specify what constitutes a "pass" or "fail" for any role's output, making quality assessment subjective.

- **B-003 — Missing Memory System Integration**
  - **Why it matters**: The Action Plan mentions MEMORY_AI and related roles but doesn't explain how the 24 roles interact with the memory-bank system or how state persistence works across role handoffs.

## 5. Assumptions (explicit/implicit) & fragility
- **A-001 (Implicit)**: All 24 AI roles are fully implemented and functional
  - **Fragility**: Medium — While roles are defined, some may have incomplete implementations or missing rule files

- **A-002 (Implicit)**: The Action Plan represents the current project state
  - **Fragility**: High — The plan is a static role reference, not a dynamic project plan

- **A-003 (Explicit)**: Copy-paste format is sufficient for role management
  - **Fragility**: High — Static lists don't capture role dependencies, phase requirements, or quality gates

## 6. Ambiguities & Measurement Gaps
- **M-001**: No clear definition of what constitutes "production-ready code" for CODEGEN_AI
- **M-002**: Missing acceptance criteria for QA_AI quality reports
- **M-003**: No performance benchmarks or SLA definitions for any role
- **M-004**: Ambiguous handoff criteria between roles in the pipeline

## 7. Consistency Issues (within plan & across refs)
- The Action Plan is consistent internally but inconsistent with the product_backlog.yaml which contains actual project requirements
- The Final_Implementation_Plan.md template doesn't align with the Action Plan's role definitions
- Missing integration between the 24 AI roles and the execution pipeline defined in execution_orchestrator.mdc

## 8. Compliance/Feasibility/Timeline/Scope findings
- **Compliance**: The Action Plan complies with role definition standards but lacks project-specific compliance requirements
- **Feasibility**: High for role definitions, Low for project execution without technical planning
- **Timeline/Ordering**: No timeline defined; the Action Plan is not a project plan
- **Scope**: The Action Plan scope is limited to role definitions, missing project implementation scope

## 9. Traceability Map (Risk & Alignment IDs → Plan refs)
- R-001 → ```1:1:memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md```
- R-001 → ```1:1:memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml```
- R-002 → ```1:129:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
- R-003 → ```1:37:memory-bank/plan/Final_Implementation_Plan.md```
- A-001 → ```62:62:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
- A-002 → ```42:42:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```
- A-003 → ```119:119:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md```

## 10. Verdict
**Risks detected. See sections above.** The Action Plan is a well-structured role reference document but has critical gaps when used as a project planning document. The missing technical plan and task breakdown, combined with the mismatch between the Action Plan and the detailed product backlog, creates significant execution risks. While the role definitions are accurate and align with the codebase, the plan lacks the implementation details needed for successful project execution.
