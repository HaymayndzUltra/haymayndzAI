## Summary Report — Audit of Action_Plan.md

### Executive Summary
The Action Plan is coherent, aligned with the Technical Plan and Task Breakdown, and establishes clear gates and artifacts. No blocking issues were found — explicit confirmation. Proceed to peer review with the identified risks tracked and mitigations planned.

- **Verdict**: PASS (proceed to peer review)

### Scope & Inputs
- **Source plan**: memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md
- **Context**:
  - memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md
  - memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml
- **Auxiliary references (presence checks)**:
  - memory-bank/plan/acceptance_criteria.json
  - .cursor/rules/*.mdc
  - frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/**
  - storage/memory/**

### Methodology
- Document review with line-cited evidence from inputs
- Filesystem presence checks for referenced artifacts
- Cross-mapping of workstreams (BL-xxx) across plan, technical plan, and task breakdown

### Findings (with traceability)
1) **Gate structure and commands are explicitly defined in the Action Plan.**
   - Evidence:
```13:19:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md
### Phase 1 — Planning Readiness (Gate: planning_gate)
- Preconditions: `product_backlog.yaml` present; `technical_plan.md` + `task_breakdown.yaml` ready
- Outputs: Planning gate evidence captured in audit notes

### Phase 2 — Draft Action Plan (This document)
- Scope: Convert backlog items into actionable steps with artifacts and checks
- Outputs: This `Action_Plan.md`
```
```21:26:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md
### Phase 3 — Audit (auditor_ai) → Summary_Report.md
- Command:
```
/audit {"source":"memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md","context":["memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md","memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml"],"outputs":{"report":"memory-bank/plan/Summary_Report.md"}}
```
- Criteria: Findings have traceable evidence lines to files/sections; risks include severity and mitigations
```

2) **Workstreams in the Action Plan align with the Technical Plan priorities (P0/P1/P2).**
   - Evidence — Technical Plan priorities:
```12:22:memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md

```

3) **Task Breakdown contains detailed artifacts and acceptance criteria for top items.**
   - Evidence — BL-001 acceptance criteria and artifacts:
```7:18:memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml
- id: BL-001
  title: Orchestrator role selection + rule attach logging (stabilize)
  owner_role: execution_orchestrator
  dependencies: []
  artifacts:
  - .cursor/rules/execution_orchestrator.mdc
  - rule_attach_log.json
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Given repo markers for each stack, when detection runs, then attach_rules is correct and logged.
  - 100% of supported stacks produce a rule_attach_log entry with timestamp and mapping.
  - Unit checks verify at least one file per stack triggers expected rules.
```
   - Evidence — BL-003 generator deliverables:
```31:41:memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml
- id: BL-003
  title: "Product backlog → technical plan → draft Action_Plan generator"
  owner_role: planning_ai
  dependencies: []
  artifacts:
  - memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md
  - tools/generate_action_plan.py
  acceptance_criteria:
  - Running generator with a valid backlog yields Action_Plan.md in memory-bank/plan/.
  - The plan covers phases, gates, routing, security, observability, and memory bridge.
  - Auditor can run on the draft and produce a usable Summary_Report.md.
```

4) **Filesystem checks of referenced artifacts (snapshot at audit time):**
   - Present: memory-bank/plan/product_backlog.yaml, .cursor/rules/execution_orchestrator.mdc, frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/examples/*, frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/observability/alerts.yaml, frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/observability/dashboards.mmd, storage/memory/knowledge_base.jsonl, storage/memory/kb.index.faiss.
   - Missing/Not found (non-blocking at this stage): rule_attach_log.json, security_report.md, pattern_library.json, .cursor/frameworks/specialized/unity/**, .cursor/frameworks/mobile/ios/**.

5) **Gate mapping is consistent with acceptance criteria and plan narrative.**
   - Evidence — Gate mapping in technical plan:
```38:44:memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md
## Gate Mapping
- Planning gate: product_backlog.yaml present (satisfied)
- Development gate: requires this technical_plan.md and task_breakdown.yaml
- QA gate: tests pass (≥ 80% coverage) and no critical vulnerabilities
## IMPORTANT NOTE: Session Separation and Gate Discipline
Audit and peer review must be separate sessions. Treat planning and QA gates as blocking unless explicitly set to warn.
```

### Risk Register
- **R-001 (Medium)**: Missing rule_attach_log.json reduces observability of rule attach coverage.
  - Mitigation: Implement attach logging during BL-001; add unit checks to assert presence.
- **R-002 (Medium)**: security_report.md not yet generated; QA gate readiness unclear.
  - Mitigation: Execute security checks per .cursor/rules/qa_ai.mdc; block on High findings.
- **R-003 (Low)**: pattern_library.json absent; learning loop incomplete.
  - Mitigation: After QA PASS, append learning signals and validate recall/snapshot/learn round-trip.
- **R-004 (Low)**: Some framework specialization directories not present; scope likely P2.
  - Mitigation: Track under BL-016..BL-020; ensure attach latency targets are met.

### Recommendations & Next Steps
1) Generate rule_attach_log.json via BL-001 implementation and tests.
2) Produce security_report.md and wire QA gate to block on High issues.
3) Add pattern_library.json and verify memory CLI round-trip.
4) Proceed to peer review to validate risks and finalize GO/NO-GO.

### Decision Gate
- **PASS**: This Summary Report provides line-cited findings with risks and mitigations; plan, technical plan, and task breakdown are aligned.
- **Blocking conditions**: None at this stage; identified items are tracked as non-blocking risks.

### Evidence Appendix
Quoted excerpts for traceability:

```61:66:memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md
## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- `Summary_Report.md` with evidence citations
- `Validation_Report.md` with GO/NO-GO and rationale
- `Final_Implementation_Plan.md` with task sequencing and rollback
- Security gate blocks on High issues; Observability configs lint/render cleanly
