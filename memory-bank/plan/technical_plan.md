# Technical Plan: AI Orchestration System (Solo Freelance Dev Readiness)

## Inputs
- Source backlog: `memory-bank/plan/product_backlog.yaml`
- Roles and gates: framework rules; orchestrator handoffs

## Executive Summary
This plan turns the backlog into an executable sequence of phases and gates: backlog → plan → draft Action_Plan → audit → peer review → synthesis → implement → deploy → observe. It maps BL-001 … BL-015 to concrete deliverables and validations.

## Architecture Overview
- Orchestration: execution orchestrator with gate enforcement
- Roles: product_owner_ai, planning_ai, codegen_ai, qa_ai, mlops_ai
- Extended: auditor_ai, principal_engineer_ai, documentation_ai, observability_ai, memory_ai
- Gates: planning, code generation, QA, deployment, and audit/validation/synthesis checkpoints

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Local-first operation; Python ≥ 3.10; no external secrets
- Two-session separation for audit vs peer review

## Phase Plan (by priority)

### PHASE 0: Setup & Protocol (P0)
Deliverables:
- Rule-attach logging scaffold; memory storage configured; atomic IO respected
Validation:
- Plan preview shows IMPORTANT NOTE markers in todos

### PHASE 1: Orchestrator rule attach logging (BL-001, P0)
Deliverables:
- rule_attach_log.json emitted on rule attachment; coverage for major stacks

### PHASE 2: Two-session audit → peer review (BL-002, P0)
Deliverables:
- Summary_Report.md and Validation_Report.md with traceability and GO/NO-GO

### PHASE 3: Draft Action Plan generator (BL-003, P0)
Deliverables:
- memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md generated from backlog and this plan

### PHASE 4: Example gating MWE (BL-004, P0)
Deliverables:
- Walkthrough producing Action_Plan, Summary, Validation, Final_Implementation_Plan

### PHASE 5: Security QA baseline (BL-005, P0)
Deliverables:
- QA security checks + security_report.md; block on High issues

### PHASE 6: Observability starter (BL-006, P0)
Deliverables:
- alerts.yaml and dashboards.mmd with validation steps

### PHASE 7: Memory learning loop (BL-007, P0)
Deliverables:
- pattern_library.json with recall/snapshot/learn round-trip

### PHASE 8: Framework globs coverage (BL-008, P0)
Deliverables:
- Tests verifying attach mapping per stack

### PHASE 9: Onboarding & Quick Start (BL-009, P0)
Deliverables:
- 30-min quick start from brief to peer review

### PHASE 10+: P1/P2 Enhancements (BL-010 … BL-015)
Deliverables:
- Planner-first checks, snapshot + rollback rehearsal, routing overrides, hydration selector, perf thresholds, templates

## Gate Mapping
- Planning gate: product_backlog.yaml present (satisfied)
- Development gate: requires this technical_plan.md and task_breakdown.yaml
- QA gate: tests pass (≥ 80% coverage) and no critical vulnerabilities

## IMPORTANT NOTE: Session Separation and Gate Discipline
Audit and peer review must be separate sessions. Treat planning and QA gates as blocking unless explicitly set to warn.
