# Technical Plan: AI Orchestration System (Solo Freelance Dev Readiness)

## Inputs
- Source backlog: `memory-bank/plan/product_backlog.yaml`
- Roles and gates: framework rules; orchestrator handoffs

## Executive Summary
This plan translates the backlog into an executable sequence across gates.

## Phase Plan (by priority)

### P0 items
- BL-001: Orchestrator role selection + rule attach logging (stabilize)
- BL-002: Two-session audit → peer review gate (bias separation)
- BL-003: Product backlog → technical plan → draft Action_Plan generator
- BL-004: Example project wiring for gates (audit/validation/synthesis)
- BL-005: Security QA baseline (SQLi/XSS/Auth) integrated in qa_ai
- BL-006: Observability starter pack (alerts + dashboards) validation
- BL-007: Memory learning loop (pattern_library.json) + storage layout
- BL-008: Framework auto-attach globs coverage and tests
- BL-009: Onboarding & Quick Start for solo dev workflow

### P1 items
- BL-010: Planner-first mode (+ confirmation prompts) validation
- BL-011: Promotion snapshots + rollback rehearsal
- BL-012: Routing override progressive mode tests
- BL-013: Hydration selector scenarios
- BL-014: Performance & concurrency thresholds

### P2 items
- BL-016: Java/Spring Boot rules migration and attach coverage
- BL-017: Rust rules migration and attach coverage
- BL-018: Unity (C#) game development rules and attach coverage
- BL-019: iOS/Swift mobile rules and attach coverage
- BL-020: E-commerce rules (Shopify/WordPress) and attach coverage
- BL-015: Freelance business templates (client onboarding, QA workflows)

## Gate Mapping
- Planning gate: product_backlog.yaml present (satisfied)
- Development gate: requires this technical_plan.md and task_breakdown.yaml
- QA gate: tests pass (≥ 80% coverage) and no critical vulnerabilities

## IMPORTANT NOTE: Session Separation and Gate Discipline
Audit and peer review must be separate sessions. Treat planning and QA gates as blocking unless explicitly set to warn.
