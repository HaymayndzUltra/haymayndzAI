# Client Brief: Gap Assessment and Required Enhancements

## Overview
This brief consolidates current gaps and required enhancements for the AI orchestration system. It highlights missing standards, controls, operational readiness, and technology coverage needed to meet production-grade requirements.

## Identified Gaps
- API Design Standards → Missing OpenAPI/GraphQL design consistency rules
- Agent Lifecycle → No rules for long-running agent cleanup, communication, error propagation
- Context Window Management → No handling for oversized codebases (exceeding LLM context)
- Model Drift Handling → No rules for monitoring/changing LLM performance
- Zero Trust Architecture → No service mesh, network segmentation, mTLS enforcement
- Role Mapping Blind Spots → Many empty cells in role × gate matrix (missing infra_ai, compliance_ai, perf_ai)
- Memory & State Management → Limited rollback/recovery support in memory system
- Compliance Validation → No compliance role/check at Audit Gate

### Dependency Security
- Walang SBOM generation
- Walang automated dependency scanning
- Supply chain risk

### Infrastructure / CI-CD
- Skeletal rules for CI/CD pipelines
- No Kubernetes/container orchestration
- Missing IaC (Terraform, Helm, ArgoCD)

### Operational Readiness
- No incident response playbooks
- No rollback procedures
- No DR (RTO/RPO, backup/restore)
- No capacity planning / cost optimization

### Testing Depth
- Unit tests only
- No integration, performance, chaos/load testing

### Observability / Monitoring
- observability_ai too shallow (skeleton)
- No SLI/SLO definitions
- No alerting or monitoring-as-code

### Technology Coverage
- Weak Rust/Go and cloud-native coverage
- No strong support for emerging tech (onchain, service mesh, event-driven)

## Next Steps (High-Level)
- Define standards and guardrails for API design, agent lifecycle, and context management
- Introduce zero-trust controls and role-to-gate mappings for all roles
- Add compliance validation at Audit Gate and strengthen dependency security
- Expand CI/CD, IaC, and container orchestration coverage; codify rollback/DR
- Deepen testing (integration, performance, chaos) and observability (SLI/SLO, alerting)
- Broaden technology coverage to Rust/Go and cloud-native/emerging paradigms
