# Client Brief: AI Orchestration System (Solo Freelance Dev Readiness)

## 1) Background & Goals
- Build a production-ready, multi-agent development framework that:
  - Automates role-based collaboration (planning → codegen → QA → deploy → observe).
  - Enforces two-session, unbiased review: auditor_ai (pre-mortem) and principal_engineer_ai (peer review & gating).
  - Auto-attaches framework rules per stack (frontend/backend/mobile/specialized).
  - Learns from outcomes (pattern library) and consolidates scripts needed in production, deprecating the rest.
- Primary user: Solo freelance developer optimizing delivery speed, quality, and repeatability.

## 2) Success Criteria (business + technical)
- Business:
  - Time-to-first-working-pipeline ≤ 30 minutes from clean clone.
  - New project bootstrap (any supported stack) ≤ 10 minutes to first passing QA gate.
- Technical:
  - Two-session gates working end-to-end (Audit → Peer Review → GO/NO-GO).
  - Auto-attach rules accurate for React/Vue/Angular/Svelte, Node/Python/PHP/.NET/Go, RN/Flutter/Ionic, AI/ML/Blockchain.
  - Pattern library persists successful approaches and is queryable.
  - Script inventory has decisions (Keep/Modify/Deprecate) with rationale and migration plan.

## 3) In Scope
- Project intake → backlog → plan → draft Action_Plan.md → audit → peer review → synthesis → implement → deploy → observe.
- Scripts inventory and consolidation across `/tools`, `/src/repo`, `/memory_system`, and related paths.
- Integration of observability, security, and performance checks into the pipeline.

## 4) Out of Scope (for now)
- Multi-tenant SaaS control plane.
- Complex multi-cloud deploys (keep single-cloud or local-first validation).
- Proprietary license audits beyond basic dependency scans.

## 5) Constraints & Assumptions
- Must run locally (offline-friendly where possible); Python 3.10+ environment available.
- Repo structure as checked in; no external secrets required for core flow.
- Two independent sessions required for Audit vs Peer Review to minimize bias.

## 6) Non-Functional Requirements
- Reliability: Atomic writes for critical artifacts; single-writer policies respected.
- Security: QA gate blocks on High issues (SQLi/XSS/AuthZ).
- Observability: Alerts & dashboards validate (YAML parses, Mermaid renders).
- Performance: ≥80% test coverage target; concurrency smoke tests pass; index operations safe.

## 7) Multi-Agent Process Overview
- product_owner_ai → Outputs `product_backlog.yaml`, `acceptance_criteria.json`.
- planning_ai → Outputs `technical_plan.md`, `task_breakdown.yaml`.
- Draft Plan → Generate `Action_Plan.md` (recommended; not final).
- auditor_ai (Session A) → `Summary_Report.md` (no fixes; evidence-cited).
- principal_engineer_ai (Session B) → `Validation_Report.md` (CONFIRM/CHALLENGE, NEW-RISK, GO/NO-GO).
- Synthesis (on GO) → `Final_Implementation_Plan.md`.
- codegen_ai → qa_ai → mlops_ai → observability_ai, with gates.
- memory_ai + bridge → pattern_library + persisted KB.

## 8) Deliverables (artifacts expected)
- Intake: `memory-bank/plan/client_brief.md` (this brief).
- Backlog & Plan: `product_backlog.yaml`, `technical_plan.md`, `task_breakdown.yaml`.
- Draft Plan: `memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md` (recommended input for gates).
- Audit/Validation/Synthesis: `Summary_Report.md`, `Validation_Report.md`, `Final_Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Observability/Security: Validated `alerts.yaml`, `dashboards.mmd`, `security_report.md`.
- Memory: `pattern_library.json`, `storage/memory/*` indices.

## 9) Integration Scenarios (stacks to support)
- Frontend: React/Next, Vue/Nuxt, Angular, Svelte/SvelteKit.
- Backend: Node/Nest/Fastify, Python (Django/FastAPI/Flask), PHP (Laravel/WordPress/Drupal), .NET, Go.
- Mobile: React Native/Expo, Flutter, Ionic/Capacitor.
- Specialized: AI/ML (notebooks/pipelines), Blockchain (Solidity/Solana).

## 10) Script Inventory & Consolidation (Keep/Modify/Deprecate)
- Evaluate scripts under: `/tools`, `/src/repo`, `/memory_system`.
- Decision criteria per script:
  - Referenced by orchestrator/rules or examples? (Y/N)
  - Tested (unit/integration)? (Y/N)
  - Overlaps with another script? (Y/N)
  - Complexity/cost-to-maintain vs value (Low/Med/High)
  - Action: Keep / Modify (document) / Deprecate (with migration or removal PR)
- Output: `scripts_inventory_report.md` (matrix + final actions) and PR(s) for removals.

## 11) Compliance & Security
- Security baseline in QA gate enforces: input validation, authz, dependency audit.
- No High/Critical security issues allowed at release.
- Auditor report must cite exact lines in plan and files in codebase.

## 12) Risks (examples)
- False-positive rule attachment; mitigated by attach logs + tests.
- Gate bypass due to misrouted artifacts; mitigated by schema and routing tests.
- Script sprawl; mitigated by inventory and deprecation PRs.

## 13) Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- Bootstrap demo produces: `product_backlog.yaml` → `technical_plan.md` → draft `Action_Plan.md` → `Summary_Report.md` → `Validation_Report.md (GO)` → `Final_Implementation_Plan.md`.
- Attach logs show correct rules for at least 10 representative stacks.
- QA gate blocks on a seeded High security issue; passes when fixed.
- `scripts_inventory_report.md` delivered with Keep/Modify/Deprecate outcomes and merged PRs for removals.

## 14) Open Questions
- Preferred default cloud target (if any) for demo deploy?
- Any client-required compliance profiles (e.g., SOC2-lite) to encode?
