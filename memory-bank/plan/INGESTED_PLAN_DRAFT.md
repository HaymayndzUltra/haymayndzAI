# Human-Readable Plan Draft (Ingested from organize.md)

## PHASE 0: SETUP & PROTOCOL (READ FIRST)

- Explanations: Establish global execution protocol; treat this plan as the single source during execution; use triggers and read-only validation.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase <PHASE_INDEX>

IMPORTANT NOTE: No direct writes to queue/state files by the agent; content-only outputs. Preserve ISO8601 +08:00 timestamps. Execute phases sequentially.

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONAL HARDENING AND TOOLING SETUP

- Explanations: Define critical transitions; establish telemetry schema (dual timestamps + correlation_id); publish versioned JSON Schemas; set docs freshness SLO; finalize acceptance_criteria.json; add CI schema validation; enable RBAC flags; add waiver workflow and disk/retention checks.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 1

IMPORTANT NOTE: Version all schemas; dual-stamp timestamps (UTC Z and +08:00); enforce RBAC for MEMORY_WRITES_MODE and AI_ENFORCEMENT_MODE; docs SLO ≤48h update, block after 72h.

---

## PHASE 2: MEMORY SUBSYSTEM REMEDIATION (WITH SAFETY FLAGS)

- Explanations: Implement atomic IO lib with ext4/overlayfs tests; provide watcher adapters; apply atomic writes to reports; serialize updates; build single-writer bridge; add metrics; staged rollout (direct → atomic → dual_write → bridge); DR snapshots/restore; migrate readers/watchers.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 2

IMPORTANT NOTE: Use same-directory temp+rename with directory fsync; treat NFS as unsupported; require divergence=0 before leaving dual_write; document rollback toggles.

---

## PHASE 3: QA GATE REMEDIATION AND CI HARDENING

- Explanations: Enforce ≥90% line and ≥80% branch coverage, with per-module floors and ≤2% regression; run Trivy with policy/waivers+expiry; run performance CI pinned to acceptance criteria; add cross-vertical integration tests; require 3 consecutive greens before escalation.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 3

IMPORTANT NOTE: Publish test and coverage artifacts; maintain waiver ledger with expiry; perf jobs reproducible (pinned env/data/seeds).

---

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION, DEPLOYABILITY, AND OBSERVABILITY TIGHTENING

- Explanations: Test orchestrator critical transitions (≥90% coverage); add docs provenance lint and freshness SLO checks; validate monitoring_config.json; enforce telemetry dual-stamp and X-Correlation-Id; create observability dashboards/alerts.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 4

IMPORTANT NOTE: Block promotions on docs SLO breach; require telemetry schema in CI; alarms aligned to enforcement SLOs.

---

## PHASE 5: ARTIFACT INTEGRITY, SBOM, AND SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY

- Explanations: Generate SPDX SBOM with digests and commit SHA; sign artifacts and create attestations; verify in CI; publish artifact_digests.json.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 5

IMPORTANT NOTE: Reject builds lacking valid SBOM/signatures/attestations; keep digests alongside build artifacts.

---

## PHASE 6: CONCURRENCY-SAFE REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE

- Explanations: Serialize PASS flips via bridge/mutex; apply atomic updates with directory fsync for master report/summary; enforce RBAC/audit for governance changes.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 6

IMPORTANT NOTE: CI must reject non-atomic report writes; all governance changes must be auditable and alert on unauthorized attempts.

---

## PHASE 7: ENFORCEMENT MODE ESCALATION

- Explanations: Progress AI_ENFORCEMENT_MODE solo → shadow → soft_block → hard_block; allow emergency overrides via expiring signed waivers (RBAC controlled); require stability prior to hard-block.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 7

IMPORTANT NOTE: Require 3 consecutive greens (including integration) before hard-block; all overrides must auto-expire and be logged.

---

## PHASE 8: VERIFICATION AND CLOSE-OUT

- Explanations: Re-run vertical verifications; update findings and reports atomically; refresh master report and summary; freeze when all PASS and enforcement hard_block; publish runbook.
- Triggers (Concluding Step):
  - I-validate ang plan
  - Show hierarchy
  - Tapusin ang phase 8

IMPORTANT NOTE: Freeze only after signatures verified and atomic updates confirmed; runbook must include commands, rollbacks, waivers, and contacts.
