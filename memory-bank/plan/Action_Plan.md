# Action Plan: AI Orchestration System (Solo Freelance Dev Readiness)

## Inputs
- Backlog: `memory-bank/plan/product_backlog.yaml`
- Technical Plan: `memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md`
- Task Breakdown: `memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml`

## Objectives
Establish a working end-to-end pipeline: backlog → plan → draft Action_Plan → audit → peer review → synthesis → implement → deploy → observe. Enforce gate discipline and session separation.

## Phases and Gates

### Phase 1 — Planning Readiness (Gate: planning_gate)
- Preconditions: `product_backlog.yaml` present; `technical_plan.md` + `task_breakdown.yaml` ready
- Outputs: Planning gate evidence captured in audit notes

### Phase 2 — Draft Action Plan (This document)
- Scope: Convert backlog BL-001 … BL-015 into actionable steps with artifacts and checks
- Outputs: This `Action_Plan.md`

### Phase 3 — Audit (auditor_ai) → Summary_Report.md
- Command:
```
/audit {"source":"memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md","context":["memory-bank/plan/technical_plan.md","memory-bank/plan/task_breakdown.yaml"],"outputs":{"report":"memory-bank/plan/Summary_Report.md"}}
```
- Criteria: Findings have traceable evidence lines to files/sections; risks include severity and mitigations

### Phase 4 — Peer Review (principal_engineer_ai) → Validation_Report.md
- Command:
```
/peer_review {"source":"memory-bank/plan/Summary_Report.md","plan":"memory-bank/plan/Action_Plan.md","outputs":{"report":"memory-bank/plan/Validation_Report.md"}}
```
- Criteria: Each audit risk marked CONFIRM/CHALLENGE with rationale; GO/NO-GO issued

### Phase 5 — Synthesis → Final_Implementation_Plan.md
- Preconditions: Validation GO
- Outputs: `Final_Implementation_Plan.md` with sequenced tasks and rollback notes

## Workstreams (from backlog)
- BL-001: Orchestrator rule attach logging → `rule_attach_log.json`
- BL-002: Two-session audit → peer review → reports present
- BL-003: Generator from backlog/plan → `Action_Plan.md`
- BL-004: Example wiring producing all gating artifacts
- BL-005: Security QA baseline → `security_report.md` and gate policy
- BL-006: Observability starter → `observability/alerts.yaml`, `dashboards.mmd`
- BL-007: Memory learning loop → `pattern_library.json` and storage layout
- BL-008: Framework globs coverage → attach mapping tests
- BL-009: Onboarding & Quick Start → doc path from brief to review
- BL-010…015: P1/P2 enhancements (planner mode, snapshots, overrides, hydration, perf, templates)

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- `Summary_Report.md` with evidence citations
- `Validation_Report.md` with GO/NO-GO and rationale
- `Final_Implementation_Plan.md` with task sequencing and rollback
- Security gate blocks on High issues; Observability configs lint/render cleanly

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Run audit and peer review in separate sessions to avoid bias. Treat planning and QA gates as blocking unless explicitly set to warn; include explicit evidence references in all findings.
