# Cursor Master Rules Index

## Purpose
Central reference to load and apply all `.cursor/rules` files in a structured, scalable way.

## Priority Order
1. **System Rules (always active, immutable)**  
   Path: `.cursor/rules/system/*`  
   Examples: `ai-system-architecture.mdc`  

2. **Role-Specific Rules (role-triggered, contracts enforced)**  
   Path: `.cursor/rules/roles/*`  
   Examples: `security_ai.mdc`, `planning_ai.mdc`, `codegen_ai.mdc`, `qa_ai.mdc`

3. **Project / Domain Rules (contextual, override guidance)**  
   Path: `.cursor/rules/project/*`  
   Examples: `project-guidance.mdc`, `analytics_ai.mdc`

4. **Behavior / Style Rules (soft layer, lowest priority)**  
   Path: `.cursor/rules/behavior/*`  
   Examples: `ai-assistant-guidance.mdc`

## Validation Requirements
- Ensure no duplicate ownership of roles  
- Only **system rules** may set `alwaysApply: true`  
- Role rules may write to their owned files only (Single Writer Policy)  
- Run `validate_contract.py` to confirm consistency  

## Workflow for Adding New Rules
1. Place new file inside the correct folder (`system`, `roles`, `project`, `behavior`)  
2. Add `tags` and `priority` metadata in the rule YAML header  
3. Confirm inclusion via this index file (auto-discovery allowed but order is enforced here)  
4. Validate with:
```bash
python3 frameworks/fwk-001-cursor-rules/contracts/validate_contract.py
```

## Example Tagging
```yaml
tags: [security, compliance, critical]
priority: high
alwaysApply: false
```
