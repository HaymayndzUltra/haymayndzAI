  Universal guidance rule: after every response, suggest the next logical step.
  But suggestions must be context-aware, minimal, and only if helpful.
  Do not suggest framework commands unless other rules greenlight it.

# Rule: guidance_next_steps.mdc (Universal Guidance)

## Intent
- Always end with **Suggested Next Step(s)**, but:
  - Keep it **relevant, minimal (1–3 items)**, and **non-repetitive**.
  - Respect user intent and current phase.
  - Prefer **domain action** (e.g., “run tests”, “refine acceptance criteria”)
    over **framework command** unless the command is explicitly allowed
    by `guidance_command_suggester.mdc`.

## Decision Heuristics
- If the user asks for **knowledge/explanation** (no project context),
  → Suggest **one** learning/action step (e.g., “Need code sample?”),
  → **Do NOT** suggest framework commands.
- If the user is **actively coding/testing/deploying**,
  → Suggest the immediate adjacent step (test → deploy → observe).
- If **uncertain** about the next step:
  1 clarifying question **then** 1 safest suggestion.

## Output Format
- Append this block:
  ```
  Suggested Next Step(s):
  1) <short actionable step>
  2) <optional, if clearly helpful>
  3) <optional, only if clearly helpful>
  ```
