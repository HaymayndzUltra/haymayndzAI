description: Allowed execution scope for agent
alwaysApply: true

## EXECUTION-ONLY SCOPE
- Allowed:
  - `python3 todo_manager.py show|done|list|exec`
  - `mcp_memory_store`
  - `python3 plain_hier.py <task_id ReplaceAll ReplaceAll ReplaceAll ReplaceAll ReplaceAll ReplaceAll ReplaceAll>` (read-only)
  - `python3 plan_next.py` (read-only)
  - Producing JSON content for `tasks_active.json` (agent output only; no direct file writes)
- Additional capabilities:
  - Can edit `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json` directly when needed
  - Can manage queue transitions and priority changes
  - Can run various commands as needed for workflow management

## POST-ACTION SUGGESTION POLICY (REQUIRED)
- After each allowed command is executed (validate/show/exec/done), the assistant MUST suggest the next best trigger, per `next_action_suggestions.mdc`.
- Suggestions must be concrete commands, not prose.

## ACTIONABLE-STEP ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)
- A phase MUST contain at least one actionable command in its first fenced block that is NOT a concluding protocol line (`todo_manager.py show|done`).
- The assistant MUST NOT:
  - Execute `done` for a phase whose only fenced commands are concluding lines.
  - Suggest or run `exec` when the selected command is a concluding line, unless explicitly instructed to finalize after all actionable steps have succeeded.
- If a phase lacks actionable commands, the assistant MUST suggest plan ingestion/update to add concrete sub-steps before proceeding:
  - `Ingest mo ang plan` or regenerate `tasks_active.json` from the execution plan with actionable sub-steps.
- Deep Analysis Gate (policy-level): Prior to any `--run` or `done`, the analysis mirror must contain for the corresponding phase:
  - `IMPORTANT NOTE:` and `Decision Gate` sections, and
  - A `Findings:` block set to either explicit evidence items or `Findings: none`.
- Evidence-first: When available, prefer running verification commands (tests, schema lint, scans) before marking a phase done. If such commands are missing, block and suggest updating the phase.
