# Path Configuration for Different Environments
# This file helps AI understand the correct paths regardless of environment

# Environment Detection
ENV_TYPE=local  # local, workspace, cloud, etc.

# Local Environment Paths (your machine)
LOCAL_ROOT=/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI
LOCAL_RULES=/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/.cursor/rules
LOCAL_MEMORY=/home/haymayndz/HaymayndzAI/memory-bank

# AI Workspace Paths (when AI is in /workspace)
WORKSPACE_ROOT=/workspace
WORKSPACE_RULES=/workspace/.cursor/rules
WORKSPACE_MEMORY=/workspace/memory-bank

# Recommended: Use relative paths from project root
# This works in both environments
RELATIVE_RULES=.cursor/rules
RELATIVE_MEMORY=memory-bank

# Environment Variable Override
# Set REPO_ROOT in your environment to override
# export REPO_ROOT=/path/to/your/project
